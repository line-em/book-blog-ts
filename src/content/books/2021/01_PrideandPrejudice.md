Read it alongside the audiobook by Rosamund Park. Favorite Scenes - when they see each other again in Darcy's home. The ending was surely sweet too, describing how their future looked like.

This is a book that has accompanied me over the years, not only as a book, but as the numerous adaptations like the movie, the BBC series and the Lizzie Bennet Diaries.

I cannot describe it, to be honest. It is simply a part of me. I love it to bits. It is witty, heartwarming, and fun. Rosamund Park as a narrator was delightful.
