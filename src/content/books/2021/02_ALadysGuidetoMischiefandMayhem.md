Light and sweet novel with murder, investigation, and a romance. An entertaining and popcorn-like book!

This was entertaining and sweet. I really loved the romance and it was simply fun! That's how I love a (contemporary) historical fiction.

I also listened to the audiobook in several parts - it was great.
