Page turning for sure, and I loved the twists and how it all made a lot of sense in the end! Can't wait to read the next one in the series.

The Greek references, and the whole worldbuilding sounded really great to me - even though it was super fast paced and dynamic. It made for a very, very entertaining read - this book should be a movie, definitely.

Megan Whalen Turner is very concise and precise. Her writing seems very tight, in a very good way, which contributes to the "fast-paced-ness". Super worth the read. **Also an amazing young adult. Definitely worth a read for young adults.**
