> “There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature.” ― Jane Austen, Northanger Abbey

> A lot of fun! I want to see the movie next. This one isn't as much mentioned as Austen's other books, but it was really entertaining. The "villains" , the naivete of the MC, and specially Mr. Tilney. Nice satire of gothic novels - Pleasantly surprised with this one. The ending was a bit abrupt, but the novel was amusing and fun. Some of my favorite moments were specially the ones on which the heroine is thinking about how the stories she read could reflect in reality, the suspense and terror, specially in the audiobook version. Chills!

> “It is only a novel... or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language” ― Jane Austen, Northanger Abbey
