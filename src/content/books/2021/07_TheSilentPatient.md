I was very excited to read it, and the beginning and overall first half were pretty gripping because I was so curious to understand what happened and why. The twist was good - but made me question the reason why some things happened the way they happened (why was she silent, then? Why did he want her to talk? How could she write so much and hide her diary after a heavy morphine dose?). So in the end, because of those things, I ended up feeling quite underwhelmed.
