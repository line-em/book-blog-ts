Short and Sweet.

The content of this book - feminism - is more like an introduction. It might be a good entry point about feminism for people that are interested in the theme, but don't know much. It's a small, but powerful book, so it's not intimidating in the least.

I have to say, however, that if you're well-versed in the theme, it probably won't add much, even though Chimamanda's writing is always nice to read.
