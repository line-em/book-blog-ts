> I felt a little empty, a little light. Happy. Not giddy or overjoyed, but that low, steady level of happiness that, in the best periods of life, rides underneath everything else, a buffer between you and the world you are walking over.

It's cute, sweet, and a little cheesy. Although I loved the banter between the main characters, some parts of it - after they officially got together - were a little too saccharine for me. But it was a light book, and it discussed a few important things like** grief, trauma, etc, with a good care and sensibility. **

It particularly made me feel emotional regarding the MC relationship with her late father. How you can both love one person, and loathe and have difficulty understanding their actions. They don't need to be a paragon of all that's good to be loved. It was important, and the letter by the end made me emotional and teary eyed regarding my own family, so props to the book for that. Fear of losing someone is strong and real.

A good book, though. I enjoyed it.

> “I don’t know, I just feel like it’s over.” “Our marriage?” Dad had asked after a long pause. “My life,” she’d told him. “I’m nothing but your wife. January’s mother. I’m nothing else, and I don’t think you can imagine how that feels. To be forty-two and feel like you’ve done everything you’re going to do.”
