Beautiful writing like every novel written by Austen, and the Dashwoods are so precious - I love their family and sisterly bond, and other characters like Mrs Jennings are a gem.

However, the romance aspect of the book is not so great as the others - the love interests feel quite flat compared to the sisters, specially Mr. Ferrars. I also wasn't sold on Marianne"s marriage, specially being referred as a reward for Colonel Brandon's "good guy token". Ultimately, I think this book would be better without any romance at all. But, as always with Austen, there is a lot of beautiful writing and I can't deny how real and wholesome he sisters feel. I love them both.
