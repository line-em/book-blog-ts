Good follow up to The Thief series. It didn't blow me away, probably because I haven't felt the romance in this book, although it's understandable. I'm happy it wasn't the focus though. The character growth, on the other hand, was tremendous and I'm loving how the main characters are growing. It made me super excited for the next book. One thing that fascinates me in this series is how the gods and goddesses are woven into it!

Definitely an incredible YA series, more on the mature side and I'm all for it!
