>“Sometimes, if you want to change a man's mind, you have to change the mind of the man next to him first.” 
I've been loving this series a LOT, but this one seals the deal.

I'm really liking these series. I love that it focus on the political stuff, and the development of the main character is interesting. Will keep reading, I think!

>“The king lifted a hand to her cheek and kissed her. It was not a kiss between strangers, not even a kiss between a bride and groom. It was a kiss between a man and his wife, and when it was over, the king closed his eyes and rested his forehead in the hollow of the queen's shoulder, like a man seeking respite, like a man reaching home at the end of the day.” 

This quote here hits me personally.
>“But there are other words for privacy and independence. They are isolation and loneliness.”
