**Disappointing.**

I wanted to quit reading this book real bad, but I kept thinking: there were so many people talking about how awesome this book was! So I tried to keep going. I swear. But well, saying I was utterly disappointed is an understatement. The characters are very, very flat, and the main character is the type that I like the least: the special one who is instantly powerful. The romance was awful, borderline abusive in my eyes. Thank god there wasn't any love triangle, at least. I kept thinking about how should I rate it - 1 or 2 stars. There were cool ideas in the book (like the woods) but it was poorly executed. It was creative, but the way the story developed made it all fall apart. All in all, I'm glad it's over.
