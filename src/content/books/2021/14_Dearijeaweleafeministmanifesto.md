> Your feminist premise should be: I matter. I matter equally. Not “if only.” Not “as long as.” I matter equally. Full stop.

Short and sweet, yet again. I recall my words for **Sejamos Todos Feministas** from Chimamanda as well. It's pretty similar, and I believe both go hand in hand.

This was a letter she wrote for a friend. Which is very sweet!

> "We teach girls to be likable, to be nice, to be false. And we do not teach boys the same."
