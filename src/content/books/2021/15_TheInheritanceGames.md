A lot of fun! I really enjoy mysteries and puzzles, and this book had this aplenty. Nice surprise. Totally different from what I expected though, but I may read the next book when it releases. However, it goes to the never ending list of books that would be better without the romance. Or at least if the characters weren't thirsting from the first moment they met. Other than that, pleasantly surprised about this book.
