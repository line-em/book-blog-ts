Sometimes I dunno why I bother with romance. I generally like the beginning of stories like this one. The differing personalities, the witty dialogue and tension. And then.... the whole drama that makes them forget their personalities (usually the women), and all... Ugh. There were fun moments though. Being very generous with 2 ⭐.

This review summarizes what I felt:

> “Some things I enjoyed: the focus on women pioneers, the discussion about women's roles and position in society and their own homes, the friendship between the suffragists, the banter between the protagonist and the love interest, and the yearning from the love interest as well. While their initial attraction to each other felt forced at first, I enjoyed their intelligent conversations - they felt genuine and showed the characters making real connections over important topics. I wish they had connected this way first and the physical attraction came in slowly later, as that would have been more natural. Unlike other romances I’ve read, the conflict in the last 1/3 of the book was actually warranted - I believed the stakes and the consequences here, and appreciate the complicated sacrifices that weighed their actions. However, I was a little turned off by how often the love interest would get angry and arrogant towards the protagonist if he didn’t get his way - this was his reaction to everything, even in the last 1/3, and it felt selfish. The protagonist also became very emotionally dependent on him, and I wish she had stood her ground more firmly in her decisions and what she believed in, especially since this book is supposed to be about suffragists. I think if she were more adamant in her values and individuality, and if he were served a bigger slice of humble pie and sacrificed more to meet her in the middle, the story would have been more impactful and he would have had more satisfying character development beyond a grand gesture at the end.”

For a book boasting how it’s “feminist”, because of the suffragettes, the protagonist became a hollow shell of herself from the middle part onwards, and it turned me off completely. Needed more of this, and less of mush romance.
