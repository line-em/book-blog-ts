Harari's books are always intriguing and illuminating, and this one is not an exception! I feel like a learned a lot. Also, I picked up this book right when the Ukraine War started, and I feel like it was the right book, at the right time. It helped me cope. Harari made a lot of reflection about Putin’s Russia, and to see it come to “life” again, even though it is completely horrifying, it was not surprising, seeing everything else he has done. Hope Ukraine can hold on to their country. #StandwithUcraine!

A lot of good insights about tech, history, religion, nationalism, and other things abound. This is certainly a book that would be amazing to re-read sometime. This explains so much of the current moment of the History, with the rise of populists, the simplification and mass-adoption of social media and so on:

> _“Humans think in stories rather than in facts, numbers, or equations, and the simpler the story, the better.”_

I highlighted many parts of this book, as it should be done. 😗

> _“Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question.”_

As an atheist, I also loved this part right here. Not exactly the point of the book, but it feels good to have my views understood and respected! Religion is good if it brings good and peace for your soul, but it is not mandatory, and a huge red flag when it starts to impose on others.

> _“Morality doesn’t mean ‘following divine commands’. It means ‘reducing suffering’. Hence in order to act morally, you don’t need to believe in any myth or story. You just need to develop a deep appreciation of suffering.”_
