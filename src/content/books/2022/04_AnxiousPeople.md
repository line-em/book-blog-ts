> “That's the power of literature, you know, it can act like little love letters between two people who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people's.”

I guess I found the right book for the right time. Its so human an heartwarming and kind. It embraces our messy side, our faults and our problems in such a delicate manner, and his writing is delightful. It's about relationships, bad days, love, and also heavier themes like suicide. I ended reading this book really happy. I enjoyed every minute. Truly resonated with me.

It's less about a bank robber in particular, and more about the threads that connects people with one another, how we support each other, how a drop waters causes lots of ripples and how our actions affects more people than we could imagine, and how we can get better, together. It was charming and sweet and endearing. Definitely a book that's capable of lifting you up!

It also has touches of Found Family, definitely a thing I have a weak spot for.

Made me super excited to read more Fredrik Backman, this is such a feel good story. I loved it dearly.

> “They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.”
