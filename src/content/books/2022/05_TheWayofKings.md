I loved this book.
It was a big big book, but filled with incredible magic, politics, worldbuilding and characters. It would be a lie to say it was not overwhelming - it was! But fascinating enough to keep me enraptured throughout the journey. I simply love the way Sanderson creates worlds. All the ones I've read from him has surprising depth, love and care. This one wasn't any different.

I think it's valid to mention one of the parts I loved most, that was when Wit has playing a song and telling a story to Kaladin, of the Wandersail. And the Found Family at Bridge 13 ❤️

**The stories mean what we make of them.**

This was an epic filled with reflections regarding power (and what it means to rule), justice, religion, inequality, responsability, decency, discovery, among others. The whole political focus was incredible.

I loved meeting Taln at the end, and seeing the whole prologue with another perspective afterward. I was moved when Dalinar met the author of The Way of Kings, baffled when he didn't act like we expected them to - and then realized alongside Dalinar that the book was written at the end of his life, after a lot of work had already been done. We had a long way to go to actually reach those ideals.

**But someone has to start.**

When Kaladin decided to save Dalinar, reflecting on his fathers words, gave me chills. As did his memories of finding Tien, his brother, dead.

It was an amazing journey, one I will be glad to keep unraveling. Truly epic!

_Journey before Destination._
_Strength before Weakness._
_Life before Death._

I will read Words of Radiance next, followed by a novella Edgedancer. Afterward it's time for Oathbringer, then the novella Dawnshard. Lastly, the book Rhythm of War. **From what I understand, the novellas are important, so it's best not to miss them!**

From goodreads:
I was _particularly_ fascinated by the Alethi dispersion of class & power being based on eye color. This is a concept I've discussed before in my circles of friends, how it is incredibly odd that humans tend to choose arbitrary characteristics to create & define social groupings.

Sanderson highlights how foolish it is when we allow our perception of others to be guided by these **meaningless lines of division.**

Race, religion, sexuality, gender. Eye color, skin color, height, weight. **We are all people.** Individuals with an exponential range of capabilities, and no contrived societal category has the power to determine what we can or cannot achieve.
