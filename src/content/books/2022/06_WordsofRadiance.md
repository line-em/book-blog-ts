I loved this book, same as I loved the previous one. I inhaled it after reading WoK (Way of Kings), and read it within a week! A thousand-pages book! I guess I was really into it.

I guess, first of all, it's fair to say this one hits different than the previous book, although both are still amazing in their own right.

The previous one focused, to me, in more general terms, about how determination, loyalty, and all of these things can surpass a corrupt regime and be glorious. It feels more like a tale of the forgotten, the people who were unfairly treated, can rise, surpassing all odds. This one, even though you can argue that it also features the "surpassing all odds" theme, it is less... universal? It's more plot-related, focusing less on the "virtues" of our heroes, but more on how can they fix this puzzle and save the world.

Don't get me wrong, I loved this book! But it hits a little differently. I loved the focus on Shallan in this book, and how we could uncover her past and all her capabilities, creating Veil. It was amazing! I liked Kaladin less in this book though - his development was great when it reached its peak, but it was too slow at times and it made it feel a little whiny along the way. By the end of the book though - it was amazing.

> “If I protect…” He coughed . “If I protect… only the people I like, it means that I don’t care about doing what is right.” If he did that, he only cared about what was convenient for himself. That wasn’t protecting. That was selfishness.
>
> “I will protect even those I hate,” Kaladin whispered through bloody lips. “So long as it is right.”

I loved the dialogue in this one. Maybe because Shallan is so witty with her words, I found myself laughing at various times, in her quips and rebuttals, and in situations she put herself in (like the whole "princess of the Peaks" asking for Kaladin's boots and meeting him later, and even her date where she asked Adolin how he could poop while armored). One of my favorite moments was when Shallan and Kaladin fell on the chasms. So much tension, development, and pure fun! Probably my favorite part of this book.

> “Do not let your assumptions about a culture block your ability to perceive the individual, or you will fail.”

[Read extra Jasnah chapter here](https://www.tor.com/2014/08/06/stormlight-archive-scene-after-words-of-radiance/), about her escape.

Some other quotes:

> “Honor is dead. But I'll see what I can do.”

> "Jasnah had once defined a fool as a person who ignored information because it disagreed with desired results."

> “He saw it in her eyes. The anguish, the frustration. The terrible nothing that clawed inside and sought to smother her. She knew. It was there, inside. She had been broken.
>
> Then she smiled. Oh, storms. She smiled _anyway_.  
> It was the single most beautiful thing he’d seen in his entire life.”

> “Power is an illusion of perception.”

> “_What is a woman's place in this modern world?_ Jasnah Kholin's words read. _I rebel against this question, though so many of my peers ask it. The inherent bias in the inquiry seems invisible to so many of them. They consider themselves progressive because they are willing to challenge many of the assumptions of the past.  
>  They ignore the greater assumption--that a 'place' for women must be defined and set forth to begin with. Half of the population must somehow be reduced to the role arrived at by a single conversation. No matter how broad that role is, it will be--by-nature--a reduction from the infinite variety that is womanhood.  
>  I say that there is no role for women--there is, instead, a role for each woman, and she must make it for herself. For some, it will be the role of scholar; for others, it will be the role of wife. For others, it will be both. For yet others, it will be neither.  
>  Do not mistake me in assuming I value one woman's role above another. My point is not to stratify our society--we have done that far to well already--my point is to diversify our discourse.  
>  A woman's strength should not be in her role, whatever she chooses it to be, but in the power to choose that role. It is amazing to me that I even have to make this point, as I see it as the very foundation of our conversation.”_
