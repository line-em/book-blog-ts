This was a short read, and it is actually nice to see Lift's development and to understand Nale more!

However, specially comparing to the other two behemoth's of a book from this series that I've read so far, this is not as engaging or groundbreaking.

Still quite fun, though. Lift is so irreverent and sweet and some of the things here are great! I love her empathy, and her dynamic with her spren is wonderful.

I believe this is will be important for the future books, so, even though it is not at the same level as the "main" books, it's still a worthwhile read.

Onwards to Oathbringer, now! And then Dawnshard, and Rhythm of War... and the long wait begins hahaha
