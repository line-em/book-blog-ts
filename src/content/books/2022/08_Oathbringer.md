Oathbringer was great! I actually enjoyed it even more than Words of Radiance, as this book focused more on Dalinar, and oh boy. His growth and his journey was so compelling and breathtaking. It takes a lot of strength to own up to your failures, to your misdeeds, and to the hurt you caused. It was inspiring and made me feel a lot of things inside.
I really love Dalinar Kholin.

> “The question,’ she replied, ‘is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your choice. You cannot pick the destination, only the path.”

There was less focus on Kaladin, which is alright, to my book. He is still amazing, and it was nice to see other characters shine - like having chapters for some of the other Bridge Four characters. That was a great touch, to hear the thoughts of Rlain, the parshendi, Teft, and the others.

Shallan is interesting too - and seeing her growth is also great. (Actually - all three main characters are completelt **suberb.** So I may be repeating myself saying _great this_, and _great that_. 😅) What I like the most is how broken and fragmented she is, and how it is represented. Her moment with Wit was one of my favorite parts of this book - as is every scene with Wit/Hoid, honestly. Talking about a story, finding messages in it, and that failures are ok. I love it.

> It's the next one. Always the next step, Dalinar.”

Let's not mistake ourselves though: this is Dalinar's book. And how his backstory is intervowen in the narrative, from meeting Cultivation, the Thrill, Odium's involvement... Is nothing less than mindboggling. The culmination of it, in the fight with Odium, was nothing less than epic.

> “I will take responsibility for what I have done,” Dalinar whispered. “If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man.”

There's still so much to uncover, and I'm so, so up for it! The revelations about the Parshendi are amazing.

Next in line is Dawnshard, and then Rhythm of War. Then the wait will begin... I think I may pick up Warbringer in the meanwhile, as, from what I understand, Azure is a character that comes from this book. I don't understand the details, but I'm curious!

Nonetheless, I will take a little break from this universe, and venture to other books for now.

> “The most important words a man can say are, “I will do better.” These are not the most important words any man can say. I am a man, and they are what I needed to say.  
> The ancient code of the Knights Radiant says “journey before destination.” Some may call it a simple platitude, but it is far more. A journey will have pain and failure. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us.  
> But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one.  
> I’m certain some will feel threatened by this record. Some few may feel liberated. Most will simply feel that it should not exist. I needed to write it anyway.”

> “Inappropriate?” Pattern said. “Such as … dividing by zero?”

Pattern is adorable. 😆
