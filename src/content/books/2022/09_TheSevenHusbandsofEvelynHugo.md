I guess not having read too much about the book was a good thing - when I found out that it was, in fact, a very **LGBT book**, I was pleasantly surprised.

The book is good. It has a solid story, and is very emotional at times. The writing, though, is not something to write home about. The book would have gained a lot with more characterization, showing more of the Golden Era of Hollywood. Although you can argue that the book is written as the narrator - Evelyn Hugo - remembers it, and some of these things happened more than 60 years ago for her, she wouldn't remember all the details. Still, I don't think this was a "stylistic" choice, as even the current-day chapters are the same kind of bland. One star taken from that.

Other than that, I enjoyed this quick read a lot. I loved their relationships, their "found family", their romance and their mistakes, and I think there are quite a lot of nice things in here. Evelyn is an amazing character - with her many faults, misconceptions and all. She is human - and she was trying to do the best with what she had.

The fact that the main character is cuban and bissexual in a time in which this was very much frowned upon, is very powerful.

Her marriage to the love of her life, as an sixty-year-old woman, with Celia was just so sweet. Her relationship with Harry Cameron (a gay man) throughout the book was a highlight to me.

It is very sad that she lost so many people along the way though. And it must be very much lonely - the ending did make some of my fears regarding this resurface. I definitely don't judge Evelyn Hugo for ending her life in her own terms. It is very fitting, a very bittersweet ending, yes, but fitting.
