This is a rather unique book, so it's kind of hard to talk about it. I'm yet to decompress what I feel about it. First, it's not a book for most readers. Lest I be misinterpreted by being demeaning, I should first say that the narrative is slow and very very descriptive, not to mention the fact that the first half of the book is about the Narrator fishing, talking to birds, describing a lot of halls, making seaweed objects, and randomly treading in what he calls the House.

That part feels a little aimless, and it may be discouraging. It's not the most interesting of beginnings, although I do get their importance. I admit a lot of people would be very bored - and that's ok. Despite all of that, I still felt enthralled to understand where that story would lead. I could perceive a mystery there, Piranesi was a thoroughly unreliable narrator, and I guess I was in the mood for a quick and odd little read. There was also something fascinating in imagining these Halls, flooded, with a mix of regal importance, and decrepit abandon, adorned with so many Statues.

This book is very grounded, specially by the second half. It doesn't bother itself in explaining all of its logic and details, but I thought it fitting. It starts to get going by Part 3, the Prophet, where we start getting some breadcrumbs to understand that place.

It felt very organic. I didn't feel like it was a big Twist, nor that the narrative per se was groundbreaking. However, it told its story well, and I believe that, for people smarter than me, there will be a lot of parallels and metaphors with a lot of other themes like religion, mythology (minotaur and labyrinths), science, reality, history. This story is a little weird and certainly odd, but it has some depth that I feel is hard to explain. Some parts are disturbing, like the protagonist actual predicament, but it's still a very "charming" read, for a lack of better word. Interesting seems too neutral, I guess.

I'm definitely content!
