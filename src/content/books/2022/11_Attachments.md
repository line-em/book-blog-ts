A good example of a good book at a good time? This was cute and quirky.

I'm feeling really bad today. It probably wasn't the wisest decision to read this book in one whooping day, but it lifted my spirits somewhat. It was only 300ish pages, but it felt shorter, maybe due to the format - which I will get in a bit. It might have earned a few star because of that. But I needed some cute, I suppose.

I know Rainbow Rowell from before. I've read Fangirl a long time ago (which was awesome, specially because at the time I felt really connected to the MC, as I was a fangirl). Then, a few years ago, I read Carry On, and it was surprisingly cute too. Probably should read others by her - her writing is uplifting, I guess? Thus I arrived at Attachments, and I was curious about the premise - how it could work and feel ok. Maybe if it was any other author, I would feel a little creeped out, but now with Rainbow Howell. The main blurb is, according to an amazon review:

> Lincoln is a 28 year old computer geek who lives with his mother and doesn't get out much, except for his weekly Dungeons and Dragons game. He's still mooning over the only serious relationship he ever had, a youthful infatuation that ended nine years ago. He works the graveyard shift at a local newspaper, monitoring employees email and internet use for violations of company policy, and preparing for Y2K. (Oh, yeah, this book is set in the fall of 1999, on the cusp of the predicted apocalypse of technology which, of course, turned out to be a lot of sound and fury.)  
> As part of his job, Lincoln reads the email conversations of two reporters, Beth and Jennifer, whose emails get flagged a lot because of their profanity and their frequency. (Employees are not supposed to use email for personal conversations.) LIncoln is charmed (as is the reader) by the women: the way they tease and support each other, the way they lift each other up in tough times, the way they are sometimes brutally honest with each other. He begins to develop feelings for one of the women, Beth, before he ever sees her. And almost as soon as he realizes he's in love, he understands how hopeless it is, because reading her email without her knowing/consent it is so very wrong, even if it is his job.
> The fact that Lincoln understands and is troubled by the creepy stalkerish aspects of his job is what saves him from coming across as creepy and stalkerish. (Also, the reader is as charmed by Beth's and Jennifer's emails as Lincoln is, and you don't want him to cut off access by revealing himself.)

I guess it isn't a surprise that it might not work, depending on how it's written. But it does, and it is awkward and sweet. The dialogues are amazing, the emails between Beth and Jennifer are great and supportive and hilarious (and it saddens me that I miss having a friendship like that, but alas). There are great quotes and blurbs, like:

> (Lincoln’s mom talking to him)
> “You were just this little kitten, and you cried if I set you down even for a second. I don’t know how I managed to ever take a shower or make dinner. I don’t think I did. I was afraid to hold you too close to the stove.”  
> Lincoln stared down at the eggs. He hated when she talked like this. It was like accidentally seeing her in her nightgown.

> **“Why do you think I can remember that,” she asked, “when you can’t? Why does nature do that to us? How does that serve evolution? Those were the most important years of my life, and you can’t even remember them.”**

And other, funny ones:

_“If he didn’t look, he didn’t risk accidental eye contact.”_ (shy me 🤣)

**“Jennifer to Beth: Hmmm …I think I’d like to be a stay-at-home mom with no kids.”** (my life, summed up 🤣)

_“because I’m not 16 anymore. That’s when it hit me— I’m not 16 anymore. And I don’t mean that in an offhand “well, obviously” way. I mean it like “Jack and Diane.” Like, “Oh, yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone.”_

Basically, it was sweet and funny, and it was enough for me at this moment. Rowell has a way of writing characters like real people, full of imperfections and everything, but still charming and endearing. It's soothing. Lincoln's maturing was necessary and well handled.

I just think they could have met earlier in the book, and some things could still be handled better. But all in all, an uplifting, sweet, warm cozy hug kind of book. Once again, the emails and the friendship between Beth and Jennifer is definitely the highlight. So good.

PS: While writing this, I found out that Fangirl has a manga adaptation. It must be so sweet.
