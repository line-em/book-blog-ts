I don't know. I was curious about this book - I heard a lot about it, the synopsis sounded like there were cool characters, I saw a lot of great art... and well, I never read anything related to Dark Academia. It didn't sound like a bad place to find out about this new "genre". From what I can gather, it revolved on mostly magical schools, libraries, but darker, with higher stakes, and a somewhat classic and gothic feel, which all sounded very cool. Like Harry Potter (the books) on steroids XD. On paper, at least with this book.

I can't say I liked the book, but there were some cool aspects. Mostly, I feel a little meh. Apparently it's going to be a sequel, but I will be waiting on some critic reviews before delving further into this series. It's at an point in which it *can* improve in my mind, but it's a 50/50 possibility. I might as well just stop here too.

Or maybe I shouldn't have just picked a book because it sounds popular and has some pretty art of its characters. Maybe I'm really outgrowing (most) YAs. It's a genre I liked so much before, it's weird to see me nitpicking it, finding a lot of faults that may be simply intrinsic to the genre. Or maybe it's alright to dislike some aspects. I dunno. But I can imagine me, 10 years back, probably vibing with the book. Edit: Technically, I saw that this is New Adult or Adult, and I can understand because there's a lot of sexual content. Other than that, it felt like YA to me.

This novel is character-driven, and the plot is really scattered. The main characters are uneven - maybe it's hard to make 6 compelling main characters (although Six of Crows managed it just fine). Or maybe, it was trying too hard to be *edgy* e *deep*, and it just felt flat in the end. The dialogue and narration was often repetitive, too much telling (instead of showing), and, maybe because of the "dark academia" badge, it tried to sound too intellectual at times, which mostly sounded pretentious and arrogant. I haven't read other dark academias to compare to, however.

The draw about the characters here, opposed to Six of Crows, is that the nature of their relationships is murkier, and they don't exactly hold each other in high regard, at least most of the time. They talk a lot about murder, betrayal, and other things that mostly sounds edgy than impactful. Like a boasting drama.

For instance, Callum is an empath that can influence others to do his bidding. He convinced an opponent to kill herself, and in the match between him and Parisa, he almost made her kill herself also, which clearly illustrates he is essentially a bored psychopath. However, there's constant repetition that he's using people, that he's manipulating, and so on and so forth. I mean, I get it. Don't need to constantly remind us! (The telling problem) Also, that's almost everything this character is. A bored psychopath, the "not empathetic empath". And while there are characters like him in books and other media that makes the story interesting and compelling, this is not the case here. Not with Callum.

As with other things in the book, it falls flat.

Most characters are kinda like this too. I like that they're flawed, but it seems too forced and too edgy. I like Libby and Reina - although the latter is mostly forgotten as a background piece, despite all her potential. Wasted potential, at least on book 1.
