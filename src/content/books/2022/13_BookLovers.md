This was cute. I don't really have much to say I guess, but this was a fun light hearted reading. I could do without the family drama at the middle, but the ending was cute and sweet, so it more than made up for it.

Maybe my favorite thing about this book was the protagonist. Usually, I feel that the romance books I read squash the female protagonist personality due to the romance. Their dreams, quirks, and everything changes, and not for the best - all due to their "love story". It is specially sad when it happens with strong female leads.

Fortunately, that was very much not the case in this one! The MC keeps their personality, quirks, and grows throughout the book, without ever stopping being herself. She is a workaholic, ambitious, a "shark", city lover, she doesn't want a peaceful life, kids, nor any of those things. She experiences some different things in the book, she falls in love, but she is who she is.

I feel so grateful for that.

I also enjoyed Emily Henry other book I read - Beach Read. A lot for the same reasons. Good romance leads, and an overall nice, fun reading.

Might be worth it reading other books of hers when I crave some modern day romance.

Oh, I also enjoyed the literary references, from Jane Austen to a lot of others. When referencing a toddler:

> Tala regales us with a tale that is either the nonsense ramblings of a toddler or a faithful retelling of a Kafka novel.

Some other quotes:

> “For anyone who wants it all,” she begins, “may you find something that is more than enough.” 
> She wonders whether what comes next could ever live up to the expectations. 
> She doesn’t know. You never can. 
> She turns the page anyway.

and

> It’s not like I wouldn’t be happy if I were here with Libby. It’s more that it would feel like I was borrowing someone’s jeans. Or like I was taking a break from my own life, like this was a period of time when I’d sidestepped out of my own path for a while.
> […]
> That’s life. You’re always making decisions, taking paths that lead you away from the rest before you can see where they end. Maybe that’s why we as a species love stories so much. All those chances for do-overs, opportunities to live the lives we’ll never have.
