I love those books. I love these characters and how they feel cozy, real, and exciting. I love reading it in Portuguese in particular, because it just feel even cozier and I love the translation.

The first book was a joy, and in this one, it is even more joyful. I took my sweet time reading it - I wanted to take my time and not rush it. It doesn’t disappoint.

> _“It was the perfect trip, and as far as Stephen was concerned, the whole weekend was one magical accident. And that's because he is the weather, and I am the weather forecaster. He believes in fate, while I am fate.”_

I love the side characters too, and their sweet dialogue. Meeting their families, their past, it just makes me wanna hug them all. Like Patrice.

> _“Patrice has fallen in love before, and this is beginning to show all the signs. That might just be the wine and the Jane Austen, though.”_

Of course, there is the crime, and the body count! And it keeps on piling and it makes the book more exciting. This mystery took me longer to unveil. But it was very satisfying, and very much a step up from the previous one!

Joyce remains my sweetheart (her social media handle, @GreatJoy69, and the implications, was a highlight 🤣), but I felt that, specially Ron, got to shine a lot more in this book, even though the stars were undoubtedly the female cast and they got a lot more screentime, compared to the rest. But their bonds, oh boy, they’re so precious.

I love this series!
