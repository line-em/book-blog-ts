This was so nice a read, specially after my Emma blues! A short story was definitely a cure 🤣 and I’m super excited to read other books by Nghi Vo, this was pretty great, a very solid 4⭐ for me.

The cleric, Chih, and her companion, a mystical talking bird called Almost Brilliant, get to know an elderly woman, Rabbit, a handmaiden who served the previous Empress of the Empire, and she tells them her story - and that of the Empress. Each chapter is like a new part of their narrative, and it’s delicate, clever, powerful, and poetic, specially towards the end and in the direst moments of the story. I dig it.

Also, this:

"Nghi Vo's gracefully told debut The Empress of Salt and Fortune resides in the intimate margins of its (beautifully imagined) world's history, portraying how the marginalized may yet shape those narratives and harness the power of stories."―Indrapramit Das

The bond between the Empress and the Handmaiden is kinda classic at first, but they become so interwoven it’s enchanting. And it’s rare to find a story about friendships and bonds like this, it’s refreshing.

It’s pretty solid, and as the book is short, it never looses it’s rhythm! I liked it a lot, and might pick up more books on this series in the future (I believe it’s a series, about the tales the cleric Chih collects of the realm they live).
