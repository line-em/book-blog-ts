**"Plenty of humans were monstrous, and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human."**

This book was unexpected and I didn't have a lot of expectations, but oh boy, was I in for a ride!

I enjoyed this thoroughly. It was a grey world with grey characters with understandable intentions and backstories and tension and it just worked.

Victor Vale is out of the prison, swearing revenge for his ex-friend that betrayed him 10 years ago. In the meanwhile, he finds a little girl whom this friend tried to kill and has the ability to revive bodies, and saves her. And things escalate from there.

Victor is an anti-hero. He and Eli are both sociopaths at some level, probably, and they have their own game of cat and mouse which works very well. But there is an effort at humanity at Victor's side which Eli lacks, which shows when he starts to take care of Sydney, the little girl, and her thrice dead dog.

And it works. The tension, everything. The ending was also very satisfying, if leaving some threads for a sequel, although I'm plenty happy with this book/series as is.

A very fun and engaging book for sure. I loved the dynamic between the characters, the weird found-family relationship between Victor, Sydney, and Mitch. So very good.

Very, very solid five stars. I had a lot of fun, way more than I imagined, and I'm so happy with the read! 

An excerpt of a review:
It's all about the ambitions, the betrayals and the jealousies of people who are far too clever for their own good. People who work together to obtain power but whose friendship is torn apart by said power. The characters - including the protagonist - all have dark sides hiding beneath their calm, collected exteriors. Perhaps this will put some readers off, but I was absolutely fascinated by the exploration of the fine line between the good guys and the bad guys.

>"The paper called Eli a hero.
> The word made Victor laugh. Not just because it was absurd, but because it posed a question. If Eli really was a hero, and Victor meant to stop him, did that make him a villain?"
