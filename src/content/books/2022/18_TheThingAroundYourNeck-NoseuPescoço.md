This one was a very good read - Chimamanda is indeed a great author, and I loved reading her short stories. This is a collection of 12 of them, all dealing with similar themes, loneliness, immigration and/or the disconnect between two different cultures (most of the time, between nigerians/africans and USA), and overall they’re more sad and pessimist in tone.

Still wonderful, though.

It’s a very humane writing, the characters are imperfect, but that’s ok. It feels ok. Her writing goes a long way in making them relatable and approachable. “Most of these characters are women, who have one foot back at home and one foot in the new world.”

These were my favorites, and they will have a crown on it. However, I will talk about all of them. The description of each is on a review on GoodReads.

- The Headstrong Historian” 👑

> “The first story in The Thing Around Your Neck is called **“Cell One”** . It begins,
>
> _“The first time our house was robbed, it was our neighbor Osita who stole our TV, our VCR, and the Purple Rain and Thriller videotapes our father had brought back from America.”_
>
> In the book’s very first sentence, then, we have a sense of disturbance, of a Nigeria which might have been. Immediately we have a sense of American influence on the young Nigerians. This is a dark tale indeed, setting the tone for the entire collection.”

> _“Imitation”_ - A recently married Nigerian woman, whom lives in United States, but barely sees her husband, who is always at Nigeria - where he also keeps his mistress. The focus is on the conversation between the rich Nigerian woman, and her cleaning lady, also from Nigeria.

> **“A Private Experience”** 👑
> “This story focuses on two women who are from totally different Nigerian backgrounds, as well as from different cultures and religions. Chika, the viewpoint character is a Christian, an Igbo woman, who along with her sister, Nnendi, is visiting her aunt. One day they decide to take at taxi to the market, to see a little of the ancient city of Kano outside their aunt’s neighborhood. But they found themselves caught on the edge of a riot fueled by religious violence, and the two have become separated. Chika is aware that she will _“comb the hospital mortuaries looking for Nnedi”_. They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. As a consequence of the corruption, brutality and the ethnic violence, Adichie is saying, life and death are often reduced to a matter of luck. Another woman, a Hausa Muslim, urges her to hide in an abandoned shop until it is quiet. The reports of the riot maintain, _“Hausa Muslims are hacking down Igbo Christians with machetes, clubbing them with stones”_ yet in the story two women, one from each side, are brought together in friendship, sharing conversation and advice about motherhood.”

> _“Ghosts”_ is the fourth story, about a retired math’s professor who looks back on his life. It is the only one in this collection which is told from a male perspective.

> _“On Monday of Last Week”_ is the fifth story, about Kamara, a Nigerian woman who has joined her husband in America. She is a professional young woman, and is bored and dissatisfied at home. Temporarily, she takes a job as a nanny and develops a new crush.

> _“Jumping Monkey Hill”_ . The action has switched again, this time, unusually, to South Africa. It is a tale about a Nigerian woman writer, Ujunwa, who attends a writers retreat, or workshop, in Cape Town, and it is told from her viewpoint. The white man who runs the multi-racial workshop of writers, is portrayed as a very arrogant and misogynistic individual. Nevertheless, he regards himself as the true purveyor of the “African voice”. It is the most autobiographical story.

> _**The Thing Around Your Neck**_ 👑, the story which gives its name to the entire collection, is the seventh story. It was first published in 1999. It is a strangled, oppressive and stultifying story, hence the title, and could be said to represent the entire collection in a sense.
>
> In it, a young woman, Akunna, wins the lottery for a much sought after American visa. Her extended family are all excited at her prospects. Her relatives tell her that soon that she will live in the land of plenty,
>
> _“In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house.”_
>
> Of course, her actual experience is very different. She begins her life in the United States staying with her aunt and uncle, but has to flee, leaving immediately with no prospects, because her uncle sexually abuses her. Her employers are ignorant, assuming she is Jamaican because she is black and has an accent. They take advantage of her, and pay her below the minimum wage.
>
> Unusually, this is not told in the first person, but told in the second person, “you”. This story is perhaps the most heartbreaking. The loneliness of Akunna is palpable. We see that in common with many of the immigrants in this collection, the young woman in this story is completely isolated, aching with desperation, but unable to tell her family back to home what is really happening to her. There is a recurring image,
>
> _“At night, something would wrap itself around your neck, something that very nearly choked you before you fell asleep.”_
>
> **MY COMMENT:** Saying YOU, in second person, instead of I, or She, made it even more powerful. Probably the best one in the book.

> “**The American Embassy” 👑**. This is perhaps the most heavily political story in the collection. It is said that every Nigerian has a story to tell about what happens in American Embassies. In Adichie’s story, a Nigerian woman queues for hours, applying for asylum in the United States. Her reason is simple,
>
> _“two days ago, she had buried her child in a vegetable path in their ancestral town of Umunnachi”_
>
> This story is set during the time when General Adache had seized power and formed a government. The woman’s husband is a pro-democracy activist, who had published a story criticising the government in a newspaper. The woman has helped him to escape and is now trying to do so herself, after her young son, Ugonna, had been murdered during questioning.

> _“The Shivering”_ , reverts back again to the United States. It is set on the campus of Princeton University, and is about a Catholic Nigerian woman, whose thoughts still dwell on a former boyfriend. A tragedy in Nigeria prompts another Nigerian, a stranger, to knock at her door and suggest that they pray together. The woman is embarrassed and a little alienated by his Evangelism, and different style of praying, but the two become close. The story follows their relationship, and the surprising history which is revealed.

> _“The Arrangers of Marriage”_ , was originally published as _“New Husband”_ . It features a newly married Nigerian woman, Chinaza, who has an arranged marriage and has moved to New York City, where her husband, a Nigerian medical student, has been living for some time. Chinaza finds that her arranged marriage in America is not the stuff of her dreams. Her husband has embraced the American way of life completely, rejecting his Nigerian identity, and has even changed his name from Ofodile Emeka Udenwa to _“Dave Bell”_ in an eager desire to fit in. He is pretentious, and so critical of her that Chinaza finds it difficult to recognise her husband’s earlier self. Increasingly, she is unable to accept his demands that she cast off her own Nigerian identity.

> _“Tomorrow Is Too Far”_ , the eleventh story, is a sort of mystery story, set in Nigeria. As we follow the story, an unnamed young woman, referred to only as “you”, reveals the devastating secret of her brother Nonso’s death at an early age.

> **“The Headstrong Historian” 👑** the twelfth story, is a perfect ending to the collection, and perhaps my favorite, bringing the entire history of intercultural identity bang up to date. It covers several generations, involving the life-story of a woman who believes her husband had been killed by his cousins. She determines to regain the land entitlement and inheritance for her son, through his education by missionaries. However, he is converted away from his roots, and only in the next generation does his daughter, whose birth name is Grace, and ultimately preferred clan name is Afamifuna, reclaim her Nigerian identity, and begin to set the historical record straight.
>
> Adichie is very critical of the missionaries in this story, both Catholic and other Christians. She also criticises Nigerians who devalue their African culture, seeking Western lifestyles, views and attitudes in preference.
>
> **The clear message in this story is that such behavior leads to a lack of pride among Nigerians. It is crucial, the author tells us, that Nigerians embrace their own roots and religious practices, and celebrate their culture, rejecting any imposed values of the Christian missionaries.**
>
> “Throughout these tales, which mostly focus on social and cultural issues faced by Nigerian individuals, we get a sense of loss, and a sense of what Nigeria might have been. Many of Adichie’s characters have to cope either directly or indirectly with the consequences of the loss of African traditions, and the exposure to Western lifestyles and values. The author criticises Nigerians who readily adopt Western lifestyles denying their own cultural traditions. She suggests that those who migrate to America often compromise their Nigerian heritage and lose part of their African identity as they try to become assimilated into a materialistic, largely white, society.
>
> Adichie’s main characters are often unable to define and articulate their anxieties about immigration, and their sense of being between two cultures. The author represents these challenges metaphorically, and brilliantly, as the “thing” around their necks.
>
> It is a powerful metaphor.”
>
> **MY COMMENT:** I wholeheartedly agree. I loved this collection.
