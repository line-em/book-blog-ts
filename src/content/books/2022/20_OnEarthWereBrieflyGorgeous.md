_“All freedom is relative—you know too well—and sometimes it’s no freedom at all, but simply the cage widening far away from you, the bars abstracted with distance but still there, as when they “free” wild animals into nature preserves only to contain them yet again by larger borders. But I took it anyway, that widening.”_

This book was beautiful and poetic, and it is definitely a story that should be told. A Vietnamese immigrant gay boy, and his interactions with his schizophrenic grandma, traumatized mother, and other people, is simply astounding, and the writing can be described by no less than incredibly atmospheric and touching. It is beautiful.

This reviewer puts it better than I ever could.

> It is not surprising that the author is a poet, as this reads almost like a poetry collection - prose poems, each capturing a moment, a memory, a feeling, or an idea so beautifully. It doesn't follow a regular narrative structure, but is instead a series of snippets or moments. The style won't be for everyone, but for those who love the raw punches of poetry, it is a fantastic book.    
I found it difficult to believe this was fiction. There is something about Little Dog's story, a certain **raw honesty and earnestness**, that seems to come from a place of truth. Maybe because much of it does. The author draws on recent and historical events, stories of well-known figures, artists and tragedies to weave his fictional story with every inch of our reality.    
The book is a letter from Little Dog to his illiterate mother. He talks frankly about race, gender, sexuality, masculinity, grief and language, without allowing the book to be overwhelmed by the heavy subject matter. The last one - language - is a major theme, and the author explores the importance of language on both a micro and macro level - the choice of individual words and phrases, and the power (or lack of) bestowed upon an individual by having access to language and literacy.

However, sometimes the lyrical style was lost on me. I tried to simply enjoy the ride and don't think about all its meanings too much - and mostly I did. But sometimes I was completely lost. And it broke the immersion a lot, specially towards the end.

The book is beautiful. But I'm not sure I understood it all, you know?

Still, a very recommendable reading, and one I can see how reading a second time would be great.

I really liked it, I just wish I could understand it more. 

A succinct review as I was travelling when I finished it.
