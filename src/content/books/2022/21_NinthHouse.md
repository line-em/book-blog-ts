That was fun! I wish I read it in Halloween, but honestly, it was only November, so, good enough in my book!

The book follows Alex / Galaxy Stern, who can see ghosts (hence being a nice Halloween story 😅) that, after a series of tragedies and death, starts attending Yale and being part of the Lethe, an institute that keeps tabs on secret societies, that makes some gruesome magic.

And then there is a murder and everything amps up to eleven.

It was a fun book. Way more gore than I anticipated, and some descriptions that felt intended for shock value. But it was fun - and I wanted fun!

I've figured out the main culprit halfway to the story (after all, there is a murder mystery!), but a lot of its details were unknown to me until the revelation time.

The societies and their magics are well developed, the rituals are creepy, and the imagery is interesting. It isn't epic nor anything, but it hit the spot I was craving.

Really enjoyed the book.

From Goodreads reviewers:

> **_“There were always excuses for why girls died.”_**

_Ninth House_ is a love letter to living and surviving unspeakable abuse. This is a book all about trauma, and PTSD, and healing, in any and every way that you can. This is a book for victims, who have felt they will never get the piece of them back that someone forcefully took. This is a book for anyone who was willing to do anything to feel empowered after something horrible occurred. This is a book about the dark and the light and the in between phases a human can go through to get their voice back.

Also, this book has a beautiful discussion about privilege and power dynamics. Leigh does not hold back truth of what white, rich, privileged boys and how they feel they are entitled to any and everything, and God bless her for that. Cycles of abuse and entitlement truly can be passed down, leaving terrible things in their wake, which will impact so many victims for their entire lives. Unchecked privilege is a terrifying thing, friends. And Leigh is not scared to go there, in the terrible acts they commit, to the horrible ends they deserve, and I really appreciated it, and it may have been my favorite element of this book.
