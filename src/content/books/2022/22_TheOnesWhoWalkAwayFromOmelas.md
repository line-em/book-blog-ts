>‘_The joy built upon successful slaughter is not the right kind of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial._’

This was a real short read - only 30 pages - but a real treat! An uncomfortable read, but an interesting one. One I reckon it’s important, and I should venture more often into. I often read dystopian stuff as a teen (1984, Fahrenheit 451, **Brave New World** - probably my favorite from the batch), but I stopped afterwards. They leave a kind of hollow feeling, being somewhat grim and well - *dystopic*. So it’s a little hard to keep reading them all the time. Still, it was a great read, and I’m happy I also finally read something by Ursula K. Le Guin! (Now I just need to venture into Margaret Atwood, to have my share of dystopian stuff written by women!)

It’s a read that makes you think. The people at Omelas are happy - way too happy. They celebrate, and they are not bound by greed, religion, or war. However, they have an open secret - down under their buildings, there is a cellar, and in this cellar there is a malnourished child, and their whole “happiness” hangs on the misery of this one innocent child, who knows not love nor kindness, and lives in the dark and in the filth.

>‘_They feel anger, outrage, impotence, despite all the explanations,_’ (…) ‘_they would like to do something for the child. But…_’

To end his misery, would mean to end the happiness of the many people of Omelas. Would it? Would it not? In the end, it doesn’t matter, most don’t question the reality, even when confronted by it. Instead, they *rationalize* why it must be so - why it is better even for the imprisoned child.

> "_Their tears at the bitter injustice dry when they begin to perceive the terrible justice of reality, and to accept it._"

Others decided they won’t acknowledge this society built on suffering. They are the ones that walk away from Omelas. But does it solve anything? It serves their moral conscience, but the whole society will continue to keep its practices. You simply walk away from the problem, like it doesn’t concern you.

It is a moral conundrum, and Le Guin knows it. The novel is short, and has no answers - and I believe that’s the intention. It’s easy to dismiss it, like we would *never* do it, but don’t we already? Don’t we hear about how “the end justifies the means” every so often? Don’t we sometimes kept quiet about injustices, just to maintain the peace? Don’t the will of the majority supersede the will of the minority - as it is the basis of the modern democracy? Go along with the crowd despite our hesitations, our concerns? *We*, as a society, do it all the time.

It’s easy to dismiss it when it’s just a story, like we would *never*. But would we?

> ‘_We all live there and people go about their business with full knowledge of the child in the closet._’

It’s also not hard to draw real life examples to the stories. Be it from drastic cases like the II World War, or things from the news, like rich CEOS living  luxoriously, while a lot of impoverished people work for mithreens just to sustain their way of life. The modern architecture and technology eating away natural life and resources. Even us, knowing we kept quiet when we should’ve spoken, acted when we instead froze, allowing prejudices and violence to spread and not allying ourselves with the ones who need it.

We are aware of the injustices in the real life. But do we do something about it?

> ‘_They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness, and they do not come back. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas._’

And then, if you say NO, NEVER, and leave… Then what next?

The short few pages of the story not only serve to tell the tale of Omelas, but also to explain where the idea came from, and why. It’s as fascinating as the story, and I highly recommend reading both the introduction and the afterword. It’s also important to keep in mind what fired the sparkle of this novel:

> Or if the hypothesis were offered us of a [utopian] world ... and millions kept permanently happy on the one simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far-off edge of things should lead a life of lonely torture, what except a specifical and independent sort of emotion can it be which would make us immediately feel, even though an impulse arose within us to clutch at the happiness so offered, how hideous a thing would be its enjoyment when deliberately accepted as the fruit of such a bargain?

Some interesting quotes, some I thought myself, some I saw in reviews. But they’re all related and are good food for thought. In the meanwhile, I will be brief and end my review here!

> Well, tonight, thank God it's them instead of you.
> Single by Band Aid, Do They Know It's Christmas?

O poema famoso de Bertold Brecht…

> “First of all, they came to take the gypsies  
> and I was happy because they pilfered.  
> Then they came to take the Jews and I said nothing,  
> because they were unpleasant to me.  
> Then they came to take homosexuals,  
> and I was relieved, because they were annoying me.  
> Then they came to take the Communists,  
> and I said nothing because I was not a Communist.  
> One day they came to take me,  
> and there was nobody left to protest.

E a versão original de Martin Niemoller, durante a II Guerra Mundial…

> First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.
> Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a trade unionist.
> Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.
> Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

Para um contexto:
> There are different versions of the quotation because it originated from Martin Niemöller’s impromptu public speeches. The quotation expresses Niemöller’s belief that Germans had been complicit through their silence in the Nazi imprisonment, persecution, and murder of millions of people. He felt this to be especially true of the leaders of the Protestant churches, which were made up of Lutheran, Reformed, and United traditions.
> Martin Niemöller (1892–1984) was a prominent Lutheran pastor in Germany. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he sympathized with many Nazi ideas and supported radically right-wing political movements. But after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Niemöller became an outspoken critic of Hitler’s interference in the Protestant Church. He spent the last eight years of Nazi rule, from 1937 to 1945, in Nazi prisons and concentration camps. Niemöller is perhaps best remembered for his postwar statement, “First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out…”
> Despite these controversies, Niemöller is remembered as one of the more prominent Germans to publicly acknowledge his moral failures committed during the Nazi era, as well as those of his nation and church.
