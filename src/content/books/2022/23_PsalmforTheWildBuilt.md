> “The robot thought. “I have wants and ambitions too, Sibling Dex. But if I fulfill none of them, that’s okay. I wouldn’t—” It nodded at Dex’s cuts and bruises, at the bug bites and dirty clothes. “I wouldn’t beat myself up over it.”

> Dex turned the mug over and over in their hands. “It doesn’t bother you?” Dex said. “The thought that your life might mean nothing in the end?”

> “That’s true for all life I’ve observed. Why would it bother me?” Mosscap’s eyes glowed brightly. “Do you not find consciousness alone to be the most exhilarating thing? Here we are, in this incomprehensibly large universe, on this one tiny moon around this one incidental planet, and in all the time this entire scenario has existed, every component has been recycled over and over and over again into infinitely incredible configurations, and sometimes, those configurations are special enough to be able to see the world around them. You and I—we’re just atoms that arranged themselves the right way, and we can understand that about ourselves. Is that not amazing?”

Becky Chambers writes the coziest and the sweetest sci-fi there is. Sci-Fi tends to be big, bleak, about whole new civilizations, spaceships, dystopias, religious conflicts, and a whole lot of big problems. Although her novels are set in a distant future, Chamber’s focus is entirely different: they’re self-contained, intimate, and **personal**. I’ve felt this way while reading **The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet**, and it wasn’t any different with this one.

Also, she has a knack for awesome book titles, I have to say!

This book is like a warm cup of _tea_ and a good therapy session. It follows the little adventure (as the book is quite short) of Mosscap, the robot, whom wants to know what humanity needs, and Sibling Dex, a non-binary tea monk whom is having troubles regarding purpose, identity, productivity, and their own wanderlust. **It’s a slice of life between the blossoming friendship** between those two characters - which will continue to grow in the following books.

It’s so good to read their discussions, making sense of their cultures and their lives. The world has left behind the Factory Age, and is now able to live in harmony with nature. The society is described as plentiful and wholesome. However, **people still struggle**. People still have struggles and existential crises.

> “Survival alone isn’t enough for most people. We’re more than surviving now. We’re thriving. We take care of each other, and the world takes care of us, and we take care of it, and around it goes. And yet, that’s clearly not enough, because there’s a need for people like me. No one comes to me hungry or sick. They come to me tired, or sad, or a little lost. It’s like you said about the … the ants. And the paint. You can’t just reduce something to its base components. We’re more than that. We have wants and ambitions beyond physical needs. That’s human nature as much as anything else.”

Becky’s work may not be everyone’s cup of tea. For some it might be too fluffy or to utopic, and that’s alright. It kinda is! However, I love how refreshing it feels in the sci-fi genre.

I enjoyed my time with this book. It was too short and the ending too abrupt to really hit it home, but it was heartwarming all the same. Loved it. Might read the next one sometime!
