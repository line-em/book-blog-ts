This book was such good fun!
I wanted a light hearted book to finish the year in a happy note. I'm glad I choose this book. It features one of the things I most long for in romance books: **character consistency!** And it works ❤️

To sum it up, it is the story of a couple who is going to get married in a few months, but things aren't progressing very well. As the fateful date approaches, they start to loathe each other - but how can they break up right now, with a expensive wedding at their doorstep, and a home they each want to keep? ~~Who is gonna foot the bill?~~

They don't want to be the one to put an end to things, of course. So they do their best to make _the other one_ give up on this screwed relationship. And this is quite fun! Not as laugh out loud as I thought it would be, but still, fun.

> This is how I’ll die: slightly unwilling but ultimately lazy.

Of course, they could have resolved these things before by simply talking, like most romance novels, but it is still a good book. It deals with a lot of issues that some established couples face. Family. How much do you hear each other. Sharing your fun, your vulnerabilities. There's a lot to unpack and to relate to, for a relatively chill and light book.

It's basically a story in which in the midst of their pranks, they start to listen to each other, and to have fun in their company again. To see the other one as they are. And it was lovely. Predictable, yes, but lovely.

There's also things that I could personally relate to, and it made the book better for it, at least for me. One example is the dilemma with overprotective and overbearing parents. Although not at the same level as Deborah, I've had some problems concerning this. Also related to not understanding what your partner actually mean, and taking it for the worst interpretation, and how it can hurt.

> How he’ll want his wife to know he’s capable of supporting her financially and she can work if she wants but doesn’t have to, because that’s how he shows his love—by providing stability. (…)
> You look at a love letter and it’s clear as day— you think, This is a love letter. But when your significant other says, _You don’t need to work. You don’t need a job_, you might hear, _I don’t think you’ll find meaningful employment without a college education. I don’t believe in you_. In my head, I’ve been assuming that when Nicholas says I don’t need to work, what he means is that any job I’d qualify for is so beneath his notice that I might as well not work at all.

Relationships can be tricky, to sum it up!

So yeah. It was fun, sweet, and it actually made me feel a little seen, so it was good! I had a good time with it, more than I thought I would.
