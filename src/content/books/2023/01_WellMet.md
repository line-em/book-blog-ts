I mean, **this is a renaissance faire romance, with pirates**. What's not to like about this? That seemed the perfect set-up and I had to read it! I have enjoyed myself, but on recollecting my journey with it... I have mixed feelings about it?

The premise is cute and right up my alley, and I won't deny it. A faire seems magical, and falling in love with someone else there, mixing a little of reality and "fantasy" with each other's persona... It's a kind of sweet, a little roleplay of course, but cute. The tavern girl flirts with the sassy pirate. While in real life, the conflicted newcomer to town slowly falls in love with the resident English teacher.

But some things are blown away and its proportions, and the love-hate seems a little forced. I love enemies to lovers, truly, but this is something that I feel rarely works out ðŸ˜…. **It's hard to be sold either by their initial hate, their sudden love, or both.**

This book doesn't do good on both fronts. Why they hate each other so much at first? And why did the feelings start?

That is not to say there isn't cute scenes around! When Emily visits Simon's home with a bottle of rum (you know, cause pirates haha), everything that follows is quite lovely, getting to know each other, the morning together, even the sex is not bad (usually I feel cringe reading those scenes, so that's a compliment lol). But how they got there... Better not to think it then!

The unexplainable hate, and the sudden love are heightened by other clichÃ©s that didn't help with the story flow, like Simon feeling jealousy because of his best friend, Mitch (I mean, really?), Emily comparing everyone and everything to her ex (I mean, really?) and how Simon is so much better and then he is just the same because he doesn't put you first and then he is the best again. Descriptions like that makes me cringe too, I think.

I mean, I get insecurities. I feel them too. But there's too much overthinking, and arguments that blow out of proportion due to this.

Oh, another thing. It's not always that I feel bothered by it, but in this one, I would really appreciate some chapters with Simon's point of view. Maybe I was getting tired of Emily's narration - I don't know - but I really wanted some other POVs.

Lastly. Why does it have to end with marriage so soon?

The second book, featuring Stacey, doesn't seem like my cup of tea (and the blurb I read at the end of this one didn't help), but I am looking forward to reading Mitch's book, so I might endure it sometime. It would be weird to skip, I think.

Despite my grievances, this is not a hard book to read - **it's cute fluff**. It may be bogged down by clichÃ©s and repetition, but it's still a light book - so I might pick up both follow-ups when I want something easy to read.

This was better than my first read last year _(Bringing Down the Duke)_, as this had its fun moments (the faire, the tavern girl x pirate moments, the "working in library" which still gets me every time - alternate world Line would love to have an idyllic life working as a librarian haha). I wasn't sold on the romance, but it was alright to start the year on a more positive vibe!
