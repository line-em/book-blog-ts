> “The Lynx,” Carmen said, choosing her words carefully, “was complicated. I love her. In the way you love someone you gave your heart to, but who didn’t return the favor. She was important to me. She still is. But I’ve had to keep her at arm’s length. Because it hurt too much.”

I loved everything about this book. Ok, there are some nitty-picky caveats I will talk about later... but honestly? I enjoy this one **so** much! It's pretty unique.

This book is set during the 70s, featuring the dying comic book industry at the time, in New York. Our protagonist is Carmen Valdez, who struggles to be a creative woman in a time they weren't appreciated, struggles to work in a sexist workplace, struggles to be a lesbian, and struggles to deal with the deaths and harm that comes to her friends. About the queerness and the feminist themes, I felt they were dealt with naturally, it's just part of the character and the story. **It's a character study with a vivid setting more than anything, exploring gender roles, sexuality, immigration, dreams, and a lot of good stuff.**

> Miami was a city, too, Carmen knew—but New York was something else. A disease that bubbled and expanded and multiplied and morphed, like some kind of magical, mystical being that seemed from another world.

Before talking about the story, I feel I have to talk about the art. I love the cover - and most of all, I **loved the comic book sequences.** They were great storytelling, they related to what was happening in the written book (a confrontation, a change of artist, etc), and they complimented it in the best possible way. I loved the artwork, and I added some to this review. Easily one of my favorite parts of this is how it wired it all together and gave it a spark!

Now, about the story. One day, a colleague comes with a proposition - to write together a comic book story. Writing comics is her dream, but her boss doesn't listen to her and she feels like the door to opportunities for her is closing. So, despite the caveats, she jumps at the idea. The caveat? Her name would remain hidden until the time was right. The comic would be a success, and they couldn't deny her credits - but only with time. Until then, she'd be ghostwriting. **Thus, The Legendary Lynx is born.**

That is - until this colleague, Harvey Stern, is found dead, shot in the head, back in his apartment. The comic is published, but there's no hint of her involvement - it even recommends other people to work on it in the future! - so what the heck happened? The only person who could answer her questions is now dead.

It is very noir in style, and the rush of trying to tie together the threads of what happened, to preserve her story, is very good. The ending was pretty sweet too, a heartwarming conclusion, I think. I had a lot of fun getting into Carmen's head and understanding the industry... There is a lot of gold there.

> The comics business was messy—a slapdash sprint to meet immovable deadlines, a blur of pages flowing from production to editorial and back before being jettisoned out the door to the printer. Carmen loved it.

Now, for my nitpicking. All the women in this book are described as being hot, and variations of the word. Repeatedly. Maybe to seem more like a femme-fatale or something? Be more noir? I dunno. I wouldn't bother with it honestly, except that it felt too much. It was like this about Carmen and every side character.

Also, maybe this is a marketing thing, that said it was a "comic book mystery", but the mystery is not the main point of the book. It becomes a better book when you see it as a character study, a story about Carmen's struggle to have their name printed in her works, with sprinkles of mystery in between. It doesn't have the suspense, the stakes, the rush of bodies piling up and the time running out, which is usually common in mystery books. It has a mystery, but it feels more like a puzzle. It's a slow book. The murder itself takes its sweet time to occur, and several months pass by before things pick up again.

But as I said, it is small compared to the enjoyment I got out of this. I recommend it!
