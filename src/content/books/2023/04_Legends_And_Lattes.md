>“She was smiling, and for the first time, the building, the city, this place… felt like hers. A place she’d still be tomorrow, the week after, next season, next year…. Home.” 

This was such a cute book. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The characters were charming, and the focus on friendship, changing your role in life... It was very very sweet.

Unfortunately, by 3/4 I was a little tired, I suppose? But maybe it wasn't the book fault. It was what it proposed to be: a cozy story about a orc named Viv who opened up her cafe.

Still, a rather good book!! A very different kind of fantasy book, and that is a good thing. We need more books that explore different aspects of fantasy worlds and I'm all for it.
