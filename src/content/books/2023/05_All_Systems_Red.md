>“It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.”

Can this book start any better?

It's full of snark and fun in its short pages. The Murderbot Diaries is a collection of award-winning novellas, and that's easy to see. Even though it's fast-paced and the worldbuilding is quite simple, there's a surprising amount of depth. Our protagonist, a SecUnit that calls itself Murderbot is a very relatable protagonist, with such a delicious narration. It is awkward, pessismistic, and it doesn't care. Until it does. It also is totally an introvert. It's such a great POV and I loved every (short) minute I spent in its head. It's a construct that hacked its own governor module to have free will.

>I had talked myself into believing that I hadn’t actually lost it as much as I thought I had when Mensah had offered to let me hang out in the hub with the humans like I was an actual person or something. The conversation they had immediately after that gave me a sinking sensation as I reviewed it. No, it had been worse than I thought. They had talked it over and all agreed not to “push me any further than I wanted to go”and they were all so nice and it was just excruciating. I was never taking off the helmet again. I can’t do even the half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans.

The plot is quite simple to be honest, and dealt with quickly. The characters are not fleshed out with a few exceptions (but that's understandable: the book is Murderbot POV, and it doesn't care/pay too much attention.)

It is a book for a short little escape. And it was such a good little escape.

Can't wait to read more about Murderbot!

>“I don't know what I want. I said that at some point, I think. But it isn't that, it's that I don't want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.
>That's why I left you, Dr. Mensah, my favorite human. By the time you get this I'll be leaving Corporation Rim. Out of inventory and out of sight.
>Murderbot end message.”
