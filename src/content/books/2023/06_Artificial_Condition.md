> “Yes, the giant transport bot is going to help the construct SecUnit pretend to be human. This will go well.”

I loved this one! This is the second book of the Murderbot Diaries (sequel to All Systems Red). Still didn't hit me quite like the first book - maybe because it felt like a middle chapter of a book, instead of a whole "novel", in a way? But it was plenty fun.

> I phrased it as a question, because pretending you were asking for more information was the best way to try to get the humans to realize they were doing something stupid. “So do you think there’s another reason Tlacey wants you to do this exchange in person, other than … killing you?”

What is fascinating in these books is seeing Murderbot develop and become more independent and free. And this book showed how it can affect other bots and constructs too. We have more contact with ART, the transport bot that helps Murderbot quite a lot in this journey. But we also see it interact with a sexbot - or a Comfort Unit - and we feel like it's dealing with their prejudices on them.

> “So they made us smarter. The anxiety and depression were side effects.”

After all, in this book, we learn more about Murderbot's past! And how ComfortUnits tried to help. Although the whole backstory is still not completely clear, it's nice to get to know other constructs and how they work.

> “Young humans can be impulsive. The trick is keeping them around long enough to become old humans.”

All in all, I loved it, and will keep reading. Those short books are amazing right now, so I'm gonna keep at it. On to Rogue Protocol now!
