> “Who knew being a heartless killing machine would present so many moral dilemmas. (Yes, that was sarcasm.)”

This series has been so much fun. For real. They're short, lighthearted books, full of fun and adventure and so on and so forth, but also with some hidden depths and wonderful character growth. It's amazing to see how Murderbot develops, how it starts dealing with its emotions and freedom and how it questions the place it's in. For instance, this quote right here:

> “Somewhere there had to be a happy medium between being treated as a terrifying murder machine and being infantilized.”

And this is so wonderfully complex. By now we know how SecUnits - specially rogue ones - are seen as too dangerous, as villains, as something you don't mess with. We have very few glimpses of the second case, but we see one of those in this book: the bot Miki, whom Murderbot dialogues throughout the entire book. Murderbot calls it a "pet bot", because it's treated with a lot of care, almost as being a friend, a human person. It feels weird for Murderbot because it goes beyond most of what it saw so far.

> “Or Miki was a bot who had never been abused or lied to or treated with anything but indulgent kindness. It really thought its humans were its friends, because that’s how they treated it. I signaled Miki I would be withdrawing for one minute. I needed to have an emotion in private.”

Murderbot has this conflict, right? It hacked its governor module because it didn't want to follow orders blindly, to be hacked, etc. To be seen as a heartless killing machine. But it also DOESN'T want to feel like a pet. Reason why it ran away from its dear Dr. Mensah: It was grateful for its freedom, but, as it phrased it, having a guardian (Dr. Mensah) is just another word for owner, and it wouldn't stand down for that. So the relationship between Miki the bot and its human makes Murderbot reflect a lot. It was great.

> "The only thing I knew for certain was that Preservation didn't need SecUnits, and their idea of a SecUnit being considered a free agent meant I'd have a human "guardian". In other places they just call that your owner.

There was a lot of action in this book, in the close confines of an abandoned planet. It felt more oppressive than the previous book, although the real conclusion will surely come next. In this one, Murderbot wanted to gather more data and evidence regarding what happened in the first book, as it connected the dots between the attack on Dr. Mensah's team on the first, and the "trying to keep research of ancient alien civilization under wraps" of the second book. That being said, it didn't further the plot too much, except for said evidence regarding GrayCris. Still, it was pretty entertaining.

I loved the relationship between grumpy MurderBot posing as a SecUnit, and Miki, the loving and sweet bot. Their death at the end was pretty shocking, ad it was the reactions of her crew. Of course, MurderBot didn't stay for that: it ran away as soon as possible in its travel ship.

Those books are great and I will read the next one asap!
