>I “liked” these clothes. Maybe I actually liked them enough to remove the quotation marks around “liked.” I don’t like things in general that can’t be downloaded via the entertainment feed. Maybe because I’d picked them myself. Maybe.

Those books are so so good. Murderbot's development is phenomenal, and this was an important chapter of its life. Going full circle. Going back to Dr.Mensah and dealing with the consequences of everything that's happened so far.

It's such a short book, full of action and stuff, but I find it discusses some deep things. What's humanity? And how it's OK not to be human too. Murderbot does have its emotions and desires, but no wish to be human.

>Huh, why did I like Sanctuary Moon so much? I had to pull the memory from my archive, and what I saw there startled me. “It’s the first one I saw. When I hacked my governor module and picked up the entertainment feed. It made me feel like a person.”

What's to like about their relationship with Dr.Mensah is how they respect each other, and how she is not afraid of it, which is exactly what Murderbot needs. Without infantilizing it. Just letting them be, in a way.

The other characters are not developed much, same as before. Although we do get more glimpses of their personality, specially of Gurathin. Its good to see Murderbot reconnecting.

>(“ I don’t want to be human.” Dr. Mensah said, “That’s not an attitude a lot of humans are going to understand. We tend to think that because a bot or a construct looks human, its ultimate goal would be to become human.”“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”)

Murderbot facing its past and coming to terms with who it is is my favorite part of the novel. I believe there are more books in the series, and I will keep reading them because I do wanna know how it goes, but i will take a short break.

Still, I loved it a lot ❤️

>So now I was not only a rogue unit, I was a rogue unit carrying a weapon designed to shoot armored security. Which is just playing to the humans’ expectations, I guess.
