Soooo. It was cute. Very sweet and lovely. Very diabetes inducing at times, but cute.

But.... I was a little tiring. I took a while to finish it, by the time I was 70% at the book.

Why do I get less invested in these kinds of books when I'm nearing the end?

Nonetheless.... Sweet. But nothing really wowed me.
