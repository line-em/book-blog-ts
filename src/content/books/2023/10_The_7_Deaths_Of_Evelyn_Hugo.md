> Too little information and you're blind, too much and you're blinded.

Such an unique premise. The idea is as follows: there's a murder happening at 11pm at the Hardcastle mansion. Inhabiting the bodies of 8 different hosts, with different personalities and stories, you are to investigate the truth of this murder. Very cool!

However, I feel very conflicted about the book. I was very much excited to read it - but it is very complex right at the beginning, with too many details, characters, etc, which makes it hard to follow. The premise held me, but it took _so long_ for me to get past the first half of the book. Your "rivals", the different rules that binds them (you inhabit the bodies of 8 different hosts in 8 repetitions of the same day, while retaining your memories - they have only one host and they forget everything at the beginning of the next), so you met them at different orders and etc...

It _is_ interesting, for sure, but the first half is a little overwhelming.

I liked the book better towards the end, finally being more immersed in the story, now that it came a little more easily to me. There were some revelations that could be more interesting, but had little actual weight - the whole situation is more like a jail you're trapped in, a test for rehabilitation, to see how you act if there's no consequences. The "rival" you befriend, Anna, whom you want to escape together, is revealed to be a criminal who tortured your sister and eventually killed her, and you actually arrived at this prison for vengeance against her.

Which could be cool, specially because one of the book underlying themes is new beginnings and such. However, as there's little weight behind Anna's actions - it was more tell than show, and very brief - the whole "rehabilitation" and "i forgive you" things don't resonate very well, as the characters barely remember what they did. In the end you "prove" Anna is a better person now and she's better not remembering who she were before, but... It makes this whole plot more finnicky. This was such a long and complex novel, to leave such an important part of the tale - after all, it's what wraps it all together in the end! - underdeveloped. It felt just tossed in, and it feels like it shouldn't be so.

That shift takes the focus away from the murder mystery, because in the end, they end up trying to get the pieces only to get away from the prison. It starts to feel less important - just a task they have to accomplish to be free from their prison. And that's a shame.

> “So many memories and secrets, so many burdens. Every life has such weight. I don’t know how anybody carries even one.”

For me, the biggest draw was the murder mystery after all - using each hosts' skills and personalities to uncover what truly happened to Evelyn Hardcastle. And, granted, we got that, but due to the tone shift with the revelations at the end, it feels _less_. Also, it was a very uncomfortable read during Ravencourt's chapters - he's a fat man, and well, the narration could just describe him so and that's it. But the narration was so, so, so bad here. When you, the narrator, criticizes Derby because he was sexist and an abuser, that's fine. He deserves that criticism, and maybe even more. The character's actions show us that and it describes his personality well. But with Ravencourt? He was described almost like a monstrosity with the adjectives and stuff, just for being fat. Continuously, he was described as a pig or a cow. It was sooooooooo bad and so over the top, every time he walked, ate, sweat etc. Just for existing, there was complaints about how big he was.The narrator seemed to complain about Ravencourt merely because he disliked being fat. Very very jarring.

The other hosts - aside from Derby who could be criticized more, and Ravencourt, who was narrated with such a strong prejudice - were noticeably better. Though I'd love for one of the hosts to be a woman, just for the fun of it! Though I understand the hosts' choices.

For me the beginning was hard, trying to connect the dots, and the end flowed better, even though those revelations I mentioned - the prison, the past, so on and so forth, didn't exactly made me thrilled.

In the end, spoilers ahead, it was all Evelyn. She planned it all - Felicity's death (whom was posing as Evelyn), her mother and father, Thomas (the kid), Millicent Derby, etc. Even though it wasn't very original, it was still cool, though a little rushed. I'm still a little confused about how Felicity's actions would make sense in this scenario, but I'm not very excited for a re-read...

The ending was fun and thrilling, though a little unsatisfying. For such a cool premise, more and more and more got woven in between until it became a little too much. I'm a little disappointed because I was sooo looking forward for this one, but such is life.

I'm a little late for my book goals this year hahaha this book took me a while...
