> “You will think me cruel, very selfish, but love is always selfish; the more ardent the more selfish. How jealous I am you cannot know. You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else hate me, and still come with me, and hating me through death and after. There is no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature.”

This was very cool. Very cool indeed! We always hear about Dracula this and Dracula that, and to know that this novel not only preceeded it, but also is queer! To be LGBT in a time where it wasn't properly accepted, this innovative and creepy, in such short pages. I totally think that this book should be more well known, for sure.

I would hapilly put this book side by side with Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, gothic stories with heart - and not very long, which I think it's GREAT for new readers.

> “For some nights I slept profoundly; but still every morning I felt the same lassitude, and a languor weighed upon me all day. I felt myself a changed girl. A strange melancholy was stealing over me, a melancholy that I would not have interrupted. Dim thoughts of death began to open, and an idea that I was slowly sinking took gentle, and, somehow, not unwelcome possession of me. If it was sad, the tone of mind which this induced was also sweet. Whatever it might be, my soul acquiesced in it.”

My only problem with the novel, because in truth there aren't many, is that the twist is somewhat lost if you already know vampire steriotypes and myths. This isn't a problem in the novel per se, though it does impact your enjoyment somewhat. Which is sad because this novel PRECEEDED the vampire stories we know about, but as we tend to get to know it later... It isn't as shocking nor anything.

That's why I said earlier that I think this is great for teen folks starting to get a reading habit: it's fun, short, creepy, and generally, they're still getting to know vampires and stuff.

> “Dearest, your little heart is wounded; think me not cruel because I obey the irresistible law of my strength and weakness; if your dear heart is wounded, my wild heart bleeds with yours. In the rapture of my enormous humiliation I live in your warm life, and you shall die--die, sweetly die--into mine. I cannot help it; as I draw near to you, you, in your turn, will draw near to others, and learn the rapture of that cruelty, which yet is love; so, for a while, seek to know no more of me and mine, but trust me with all your loving spirit.”

Yet, this is deliciously creepy! I saw Carmilla in other adaptations, most recently in Castlevania, and I got a new admiration for her character. The mix of creepy, gothic, and some clear odd infatuation between Carmilla and Laura is amazing.

Carmilla is decidedly creepy: an immortal beauty that haunted Laura since childhood, and her methods imply worming into families, pretending to be just an accomplished but hurt young woman, creating bonds with everyone, creeping into their dreams, until ultimately, she strikes, biting and sucking their prey lives very very slowly, until they died.

I loved the read, I just wish I didn't know much about vampires to properly enjoy this _more_!

> “I have been in love with no one, and never shall," she whispered, "unless it should be with you."Shy and strange was the look with which she quickly hid her face in my neck and hair, with tumultuous sighs, that seemed almost to sob, and pressed in mine a hand that trembled.
> Her soft cheek was glowing against mine. "Darling, darling," she murmured, "I live in you; and you would die for me, I love you so."
