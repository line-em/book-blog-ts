These books feel like a cozy evening with a warm cup of tea, cat cuddles and warm embraces. Yes, there is murder and stuff! But the characters are so, so precious. I just love hanging out with them. It's like meeting an old group of friends.

I still find it an amazing mix of heartfelt moments and fun banter, seriousness regarding their old age, and also some really clever stuff. It's heartbreaking reading about Stephen's Alzheimer getting worse, but also really fun when Joyce baits the Viking on not killing a retired woman as his first target and ultimately even poisoning him! XD.

There are a lot of fun moments in this book, I think it had marvellous moments in this regard. The mystery was a little more disjointed than the second case, as there were two separate cases going on - the reporter that fell off a cliff after following a dirty money track, and Viking, that kidnapped Elizabeth and Stephen, and threatened her on killing an old friend.

In the end, both cases merged and helped each other and it was great. But during most of the book, they didn't feel equal - one had a lot more weight than the other, and it overshadowed it. So I felt like the previous book **developed** better, though I still loved this one all the same.

I can only hope I have such an awesome group of friends when I get older! XD

> “It’s the people, in the end, isn’t it?” says Viktor. “It’s always the people. You can move halfway around the world to find your perfect life, move to Australia if you like, but it always comes down to the people you meet.”

I read somewhere that, while young adult books and the like can be fun, they are, ultimately, about a time you can never go back to. This book, however, is a fantasy about a time we most likely WILL experience, and that we have way less good depictions in media and the like. That resonated with me, and I think it's one of the many reasons I love this book.

I believe this book is also a stepping stone for the next, and possibly, the last book in the series? (Though this series got very famous, so I'm not entirely sure it will end so soon!) Despite her few appearances, Connie, one of the main antagonists in the series - and a major one in the second book - had a few important scenes in this book:

1. Ibrahim is now her therapist, and has genuinely grown sorta fond of her.
2. She has cooperated with him and befriended a suspect in the case they were investigating.
3. She has a lot of priviledges in prison, and hopes to get released soon, specially as she "helped" a murder case.
4. She clearly says that she wants revenge, and by the end, it has become clear she forged notes for Ibrahim, lied and manipulated him. How she values the friendship they forged is currently unknown.

So yes. While technically she is still in jail, I'm pretty sure she will come back. There's a lot of threads to pursue here.

Nonetheless, all in all, I had a LOT of fun with this book. Second one is still my favorite, but this was so fun. Very very excited for the next book!
