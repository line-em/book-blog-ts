This was a different experience than many of the previous entries at this blog, and maybe that's why it's rated so high, despite a lot of pet peeves I had: I buddy read with a friend! And, honestly, everything turns out better when doing it together... even if you're complaining and stuff ðŸ¤£

Basically, the story follows our protagonist, Violet, daughter of an important military woman, who against her wishes, goes to the Riders Quadrant in order to become a Dragon Rider, a soldier, and protect her city from a war.

Despite the sex scenes later, it does feel a lot like YA. There is interesting lore and stuff, though a lot of what was in this book could be summarized with "missed opportunity". The biggest offenders in this regard were the male leads, Dain and Xaden.

Dain was the childhood friend, obssessed with order and rules. Xaden is the "enemy", as he is branded, rebellious and ruthless and Violet should stay away from him. YA much? It felt to me too much Shadow and Bone, at least at first, though none of those felt as interesting to me as the Darkling, who actually had a lot going on for him.

Me and my friend both described Dain as having got the shortest end of the stick. Incredibly annoying, boring, and generally a pain in the ass, and that's when I'm feeling generous. We can NEVER feel the childhood bond between him and the MC. They never feel close, nor as friends. There's also not that feeling of, "I love you, but you're not the same anymore". I mean, they tell us this all the time - Dain is different, bla bla bla -, but in general there feels like there is a void between them, both past and present. And gosh, does it hurt the reveal at the ending. It would hurt so good if they actually FELT like they were close!

As for Xaden, the way people _talk_ about him is interesting, I will grant you this. But as you slowly unravel the "mystery" of Xaden, he becomes that bland mix of all the perfect love interests in the existence. So perfect there's no downsides. Ohhhh but he is a rebel! He is so _ruthless_! Every one of his deemed flaws are like when you say your flaw is "perfectionism". It doesn't mean shit. By the end, he even got his own POV and gosh. What. A. Drag. Basically his story is that he was insta-love with Violet but hide because of ~ reasons ~, and he can barely keep his pants every time he sees her. There. That's all there is to it.

And some interactions doesn't even make sense and in retrospect, are so bland and paper thin! The murderous kids trying to kill Violet, like, it serves no purpose. Oooooh but it is a _dangerous_ place. Yeah, gotcha. No need for the murderous kids anyway, as they all died without a real purpose anyway. The reasoning was also SO fickle, like: She is the weakest link! Weakest link! Just because, hm, she weren't exactly built with muscles and the such? Yeah. Sound reasoning.

The rebellious kids HAVE a better reason for hating her, but it all fell flat at the latest relevation for me. But, here it goes, nonetheless: Her mother is resposible for making 107 orphans during a rebellious uprising, and she would kill even the orphans, weren't for Xaden's sacrifice. He got 107 lashings for every kid still alive, and would be personally punished if they ever betrayed Navarre. Brutal beginning though, and kinda understandable for them to be resentful to study with the daughter of the woman who did this. They say like they resent all Sorrengails. Imogen breaks Violet's arms and threatenings gallore.

HOWEVER. Spoiler for the last page, but basically, they've been all working together with Violet's brother, Brennan, who was thought to be dead. So like, why were they hating on the daughter, but apparently cooperating and peacefully working with the brother? It makes no sense. They didn't know Violet, so it doesn't make sense to me how they singled her out... And if it's the name they are resentful, how come they are a-ok with her brother? It seems like, their reactions for Violet were just for drama.

I truly hope Brennan talks or has flashblacks in the sequel, showing he had difficulties working with them at least.

But yeah... a lot of pet peeves, being honest. The best part of the book though were the dragons. They were fun, so I didn't bother that Violet was so special that she got to. Forgiven, sister! The more dragons, the merrier ðŸ’– And I did like everything about the dragons. Their abilities, how terrifying they are, their bonds, relationships, personalities... The best part of the book, by far.

I will keep reading this series, mostly because I will be buddy reading. But I'm reeeeeally not invested on the ROs, hopefully next book focuses more on the sibilings relationships, dragons, even Violet herself. And less Xaden and drama. Please.
