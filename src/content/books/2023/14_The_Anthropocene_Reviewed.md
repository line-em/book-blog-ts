> “To fall in love with the world isn’t to ignore or overlook suffering, both human or otherwise. For me anyway, to fall in love with the world is to look up at the night sky and feel your mind swim before the beauty and the distance of the stars. It is to hold your children while they cry and watch the sycamore trees leaf out in June. When my breastbone starts to hurt, and my throat tightens and tears well in my eyes, I want to look away from feeling. I want to deflect with irony or anything else that will keep me from feeling directly. We all know how loving ends. But I want to fall in love with the world anyway, to let it crack me open. I want to feel what there is to feel while I am here.”

This book was so warm and charming. I had a good time reading it and sharing some of my favorite stories and tidbits with my husband.

> “Gatsby is a critique of the American Dream. The only people who end up rich or successful in the novel are the ones who start out that way. Almost everyone else ends up dead or destitute. And it’s a critique of the kind of vapid capitalism that can’t find anything more interesting to do with money than try to make more of it. The book lays bare the carelessness of the entitled rich—the kind of people who buy puppies but won’t take care of dogs, or who purchase vast libraries of books but never read any of them.”

It was also very unique. A blend of non fiction, autobiography, short stories, random reviews and maybe even some more stuff. The end result was, in general, delightful. Of course, due to this structure, I did like some "reviews" (or chapters) more than others, but that is to be expected in a book of this nature.

> “I'll never again speak to many of the people who loved me into this moment, just as you will never speak to many of the people who loved you into your now. So we raise a glass to them--and hope that perhaps somewhere, they are raising a glass to us.”

Some of my personal favorites were due to being relatable, discovering something new, for being a interesting thought about a topic, a unique viewpoing I didn't consider, and so on. Here it goes: **Googling Strangers, Teddy Bear, CNN, The World's Largest Ball of Paint, Halley's Comet, Our Capacity for Wonder, The Hall of Presidents, Air Conditioning, Harvey, The Yips, Auld Lang Syne, Jerzy Dudek's Performance on May 25, 2005, Monopoly, Bonneville Salt Flats, Hiroyuki Doi's Circle Drawings**

> “You can't see the future coming--not the terrors, for sure, but you also can't see the wonders that are coming, the moments of light-soaked joy that await each of us.”

There's emotional reviews, society's problems analysis, heartfelt moments which acknowledges the shortcomings of ours lives, our faults and mistakes and our achievements, with such a wholesome undertone. I wholeheartedly recommend this book, though you have to be open mind about it's structure. It's an unique book, after all. Delightful as it was for me, I do think not every reader will be enthralled by this.

> “After the death of the poet Jane Kenyon, her husband Donald Hall wrote, “We did not spend our days gazing into each other’s eyes. We did that gazing when we made love or when one of us was in trouble, but most of the time our gazes met and entwined as they looked at a third thing. Third things are essential to marriages, objects or practices or habits or arts or institutions or games or human beings that provide a site of joint rapture or contentment. Each member of a couple is separate; the two come together in double attention.”

Thought, being honest, the way it portrays our human nature _is_ very human, very humbling, and fascinating, and if it sounds even a little bit interesting to you, give it a go. Take a review you feel more attracted to and just roll with it.

> “The five-star scale has only been used in critical analysis for the past few decades. While it occasionally applied to film criticism as early as the 1950s, the five-star scale wasn’t used to rate hotels until 1979, and it wasn’t widely used to rate books until Amazon introduced user reviews. The five-star scale really doesn’t exist for humans; it exists for data aggregation systems, which is why it did not become standard until the internet era. Making conclusions about a book’s quality from a 175-word review is hard for artificial intelligences, where as star ratings are ideal for them.”

It reads hopeful and bright and awesome. So good. A good mug of tea in a warm cozy blanket, that makes you feel good, think, and feel embraced at the same time.

Is there any space left for more quotes? XD

> Now always feels infinite and never is.
