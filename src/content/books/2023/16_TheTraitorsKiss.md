I kinda marathoned this book in one day - which was fun, I admit. I was so slow while trying to read The Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb - which I guess I will DNF for now, at least - that it was _nice_ to actually read something intensely, like, I still got it, in a way!

The book, however, is not exactly a super book, far from it. But I will still give it 3 stars because it was fun enough to keep me entertained. It was a fast read and exactly what I needed.

The main things I didn't like about this book was:

-   The MC was very problematic at various points. First of all, one my biggest pet peeves, is: 'oh, she is not like the other girls', and she is basically defined by it. Can't she be different/tomboyish, without demeaning others? Also, she knew too much and was simply impossibly smart. She knew her father's craft, things he taught her, alright, that's valid. But then she knew various languages, knew more military stuff than even the escorts, and was basically Sherlock-ing her way too much into things! So things were _very_ imbalanced, though I understand it is common enough in those kinds of books... But still, it felt very Mary Sue-ish.
-   The whole military/villain/stuff was shallow as heck. All around people were dumbed down, possibly to show just how amazing the MC was, at least that was my impression. The whole castle siege and stuff was so very shallow, predictable, and offered no challenge whatsoever. A certain character death felt simply like a plot device to shock.
-   The spy/hiding identities was very fun at first, but then everything went downhill, even if the end _was_ surprisingly nice between them. But the whole thing with the climax and revelations could've gone better, I think. The mighty captain became really really dumb, and for someone who supposedly was very stable, was acting as a spy and so on, he showed very little composure and sense? Romance like this lives and dies by its _banter_, by the misconceptions and mysteries... when the masks fell off, everything fell off. The first part of the book was miles ahead of the second.
-   That being said, it kinda works _as a standalone_. I saw it was a trilogy... but the mess of the worldbuilding with the rival countries don't exactly inspire much confidence for the future. I mean, I haven't read it, but I reeeeeeally think everything was very shallow and convenient here. It's sorta enough for a standalone, but more than that and I'm skeptical. This is no **Queen's Thief**. Still one of the best worldbuilding/deceiving plot in any YA I've read.

So yeah... plot-wise not the best, though the whole hiding identities was fun enough to keep me hooked for a while through the book - and then it was a short ride to the end so I kept to it. Never liked the whole better-than-thou personality of both main characters from the start, but heh, entertaining if I don't think too much about it. Also, surprisingly for these types of books, the end was actually sorta healthy? The characters respecting each other's choices and all. So, props to it. Still, the last half part felt weak.

> “We each play several roles in life – that doesn’t make them all lies.”

So, all in a all. An entertaining read, as long as I can ignore some pet peeves and don't think too hard over it.
