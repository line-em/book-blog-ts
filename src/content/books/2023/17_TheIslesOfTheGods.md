This would be a great adventure flick, I think. I knew full well the book was kinda teen and it held true to its word - so while def not a super deep book, it was fast and easy and fun. I couldn't fault the book for being teen, I mean, that's what I signed up for! But the 'handsome flirty stranger', 'the quirky and awkward sidekick', 'angsty backstory friend looking for redemption' and some stuff still irks me üòÖ The setup for the main characters weren't very original, even though they had clear motivations and all.

Other than that, I think it's quite positive, as far as those books go. The main trio had a healthy companionship, the main character was capable but in a believable way, and the main romance, while chaste (to be expected), flowed naturally and without unnecessary drama, which is a gulf of fresh air. So, yeah, I think it's a good book for teens, and it also got high stakes and all!

The story is mostly about their survival and their struggles to find a way to reach the Isles, for a rite to be completed. And it's fun to get there. It was a nice... Ride? Sail? Journey?

I admit I didn't fully understood some magic descriptions, but it did scratch my pirate itch a little bit. Sailing the seas and braving the unknown! The ending was totally a cliffhanger though. I hope the next book describes more of its magic system.

But all in all, good fun, and it was a good choice to accompany me in my trip - I wanted something engaging that wouldn't make me sleepy! And it delivered in that regard. It wasn't exactly out of this world good, hence the grade, but a nice book in the teen spectrum with an above average romance within the niche.
