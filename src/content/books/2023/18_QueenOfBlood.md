The word I'd use to best describe this book is - **worldbuilding**. It lives and dies by it, and it's very immersive, brutal and interesting. It's a complex world that is always on the edge of everything falling apart - it develops and grows with the spirits, in its chaotic creativity and impulses to build and destroy. The spirits, however, have a strong instinct to kill humans, seen as a thorn, getting in the way of their wild nature. The only thing keeping the balance is a Queen - a trained magically attuned girl who can command the spritis - guiding and controlling their bloodlust.

The story begins with the protagonist village being destroyed by spirits - a lack of control from their Queen, perhaps? - and her home barely surviving the massacre. The girl - Daleina - has the gift, even though it is weak. She protected her family by instinct, but nothing more.

It also follows the POV of a disgraced champion, Ven, roaming the outskirts, doing bodyguard work and protecting villages whenever he can. We also follow several other POVs, but only occasionaly, and usually shorter.

It is kinda in the middle between a young adult fantasy and a adult one. It is not fully adult - at least I don't think so - but it feels more mature than most YA. Maybe because it doesn't follow some of the most common tropes, like the love triangle, and the protagonist with uncapped potential/chosen one. On the contrary, the romance is barely there, and time and time again we see the MC more as resourceful than powerful, always ranked last, always struggling to do what comes easily to others. It's mostly hard work.

Still, it is undoubtedly YA. It is a sort of coming of age story, with magic schools, budding friendships, questioning the ways the society works, a relatable protagonist and a fun and spiraling world. Not quite The Thief series or the Clockwork Angel for me, but definitely a great YA and a cut above the average for sure. I am in love with the worldbuilding in this one, and the ending was brutally heart wrenching and overall amazing.

> “Coming home is hard." Ven said.
> "It shouldn't be" Daleina said. "They love me. I love them. It should be easy."
> "Once you leave, it's never easy again. Or at least it's never the same. You're not the same. You can't expect them to be.
> She nodded. "Sometimes they feel like strangers. And still, I'd die to protect them.”

One thing I didn't quite like was the name of the book - it seems very generic, to me. Although I gotta say the name _is_ well thought out, as it makes sense during the story. The story explores themes such as corruption, the price of power, moral debates and so on. Light spoilers ahead: From the middle of the book onwards, we see the current queen even described as a Queen of Blood due to what she does - the deals she strikes with the spirits for more power, and the blood cost that steadily increased, permitting them to destroy even entire villages. However, the ending twists this definiting in a brutally interesting and sad way.

Bigger spoilers ahead!

I loved the ending. I think the book started strong, grew a little mild in the middle, and then picked up the pace again in the last part, as the characters got to know the reaches of what the current queen, Fara, was doing. The main trio schemed a way to punish the queen if she ever took more deals - which she did. And the queen died, but not before issuing an order for the spirits to kill all heirs. - If the spirit she made the deal with, the Owlwoman, actually heeded it, I believe it's up for debate, being a little open ended in the book.

That made the Queen position open for a new heir, as is tradition. Fact is, Daleina couldn't forgive herself for committing regicide, and she didn't want to be a part of it anymore. She conceded to go to the ceremony more to complete the cycle - and to be with her friends, to see what would become of their country, Renthia. It was in a secluded place, meant to be a solemn and peaceful choosing, with only the heirs themselves and no one else. All the entrances are shut.

But all hell breaks loose when the Owlwoman appears, proclaiming herself Queen and commanding all the spirits to kill the heirs.

The battle is brutal, and we see the girls falling, one by one. The deaths are gruesome, impaling, missing limbs, twisting body parts. It's a bloodbath. With only a few heirs remaining, Daleina thinks of a plan, a last resort for them to actually stop the killing. And it _works_. Until she looks down and see that no. It wasn't enough. They all fell all the same.

All 50 heirs, dead at varying stages of disturbing. Her friends. People she grew up with. People she didn't know, but felt a kinship anyway because they were all the same. A multitude of spirits dead, blood everywhere, staining her white ceremonial dress. She was the last one standing. She was always last, wasn't she?

With no Queen, the spirits were growing wild again. Kill, kill, kill. And there was no one else that could control them, with all the candidates dead. She despised and hated it completely, but she had no choice, did she? Someone had to step in. There should be someone one - but there wasn't.

When she emerged from the grove, to meet with all whom were expecting the result of the ceremony, she came alone, hurt and bloodied. It wasn't a triumph.

And thus, she became Queen. Bards sang her tale, the survivor, though she never learnt its lyrics - she couldn't bear it. They called her the Queen of Blood.

I **love** the ending. It goes against what you'd expect from a book like this - it ends with a sort of sour mood, though hopeful, because throughout the book we get to know Daleina and she'd _make_ a good queen. But it wasn't a powerful moment. It was desperate and cruel.

My rating is possibly based on this. The worldbuilng and the magic, the strong start and great ending. The ending was so good I added an extra half star 🤭

I'm excited for the next book, The Reluctant Queen.
