This was a short story I choose to read from **The Far Reaches** story collection, which has several stories from authors such as James S. A. Corey from The Expanse üòÄ. I picked up a few to sprinkle in between longer books, and this was the first one I choose!

JOoJR follows the tale of Tornado, a black woman chosen to pilot a Miri - a living, sentient ship. There were a lot of search for compatiple people to pilot them, and they were offered a deal: 10 years in space, in solitude, to study and watch their bonds with the ship - for 10 million dollars, they would receive after their return to Earth. 7 people were found.

5 years have passed, and now in the middle of their journey, the company behind it all decided that they could meet the other 7 humans. Their ships could connect, bond, and they could have some social interaction at last.

The book is sorta domestic, and more like a fantasy allegory set in space, than science fiction per se. Still, although it didn't explain how the ship actually works and travel, I find the image quite charming. It would fit right besides books such as **The Long Way to A Small Angry Planet** from Becky Chambers. Still, I gotta say I liked the latter one more.

The book is brief, but it was interesting to see how each of them shaped their Miris and all. However, although it could be sorta explained by their lack of social interactions and being sorta rusty at it, there were some stuff that was weird. For such a small tale, it seemed like they focused too much on stuff like allergies, etc, while there was only one group meeting in which they talked about their experiences. There was too little _space_. They've been travelling for 5 years now, I wish there was more insight on their experiences as a whole.

A bit spoiler-ish, but there was one interaction that irked me. One of them had giant crabs, and he considered them friends and all the characters bonded with them. Until one of the main characters, Anthony, decided to snatch one of them and kill it to _cook_. He said he would 'miss' a crab dish in the following 5 years. It was in such bad taste. Yeah, they were all rough around the edges at the whole social thing, but this was too much. Anthony was lightly admonished for his actions..... and this episode barely had any consequences. Not only that, but the protagonist still had an affair with him and even his child, after what happened. I mean.... to each their own, but the whole sequence was weird.

So... yeah. The whole social dynamic between the characters felt odd.

Nnedi Okorafor writes beautifully though, as I said, I loved the miris and how each character shaped their living ships. But the plot and the characters didn't hold for me. As I said, it could be a sort of allegory, but there is no message at the end, not at all, so it falls a little flat.

I heard good things about the other two I want to follow up with - Void and How it Unfolds.

But first, gonna read the second book of the **Queens of Renthia** series. üí™üèº
