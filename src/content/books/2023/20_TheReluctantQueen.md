> “Don't confuse mercy for forgiveness.”

This was **amazing**, so very very amazing. Definitely keeping with this series for now, as there's only one book left in the trilogy! I love that this series does a lot of things differently, and it feels truly exciting, refreshing and dangerous, at times. I love how things don't feel forced, we don't need to be told how perillous it all is... It IS perillous and we know it.

It is an YA book, sure, but it has maturity. It makes me think of The Thief series - which I must read again soon! - and though the plot is different, I really do appreciate YA like this. The characters feel mature, the danger feels real, and we're not lost in an endless sea of pining and drama. The plot and all its complexities are drama enough.

In this one, our main character is a mom, Naelin. Her hair is starting to grey, and she very much don't want this - she wants a peaceful life with her family and children. She wants her life. And it feels truly beliveable, all the stages Naelin goes through. Even parts like the divorce - something you don't usually see in books like this, but so very well handled.

> “I wanted to matter. For my life to matter. So many people die and no one knows they ever existed. They're ripples in a stream, disappearing when the wind blows.”

It was amazing to see characters such as Merecot again, even if briefly, and other characters that were introduced in this book were also marvellous. I enjoyed Master Garnah a lot - curiously, also a mother, but very different from Naelin. She's manipulative and selfish, but so cunning, so interesting, it was great to see her - she also added a lot to Hammon's character, and he sorely needed it. The whole Arin (Daleina sister), Hammon and Garnah connections and complexities were great to see.

This is more plot focused than character focused, true, but it is all the better for it, I think.

> “I loved him. And he thought that meant that he had no responsibilities.”

Daleina is dying. She has the false death - and every time she blacks out, the spirits go rogue. The problem is, all the trained heirs were killed at the previous book - so what should she do? Also, Queen Merecot is starting an invasion. It's two plot threads that converge very cleanly, and I loved how each character developed more in this book.

I do believe I liked this more than the first, due to this maturity thing. The characters, the new responsabilities, everything that happens don't feel pointless. The uneeded parts were cut.

There's also a new mystery by the end of the book - one I'm eager to know more of!

> “She was our friend and our enemy, Chancellor Xanon," Naelin said. "We will mourn our friend who was killed by our enemy. Surely you understand that a life is more complex than a label. We can love who she was while we hate what she's done.”

I loved this. There were some inconsistencies however, which made me lower the score a bit.

- Doesn't the royal guards get background checks? This wasn't explained and seems like a security risk lol
- Aren't the heirs the only ones who can Choose! the spirits and make them stop?

But despite some nitpicks and the slow start... I loved this a lot.

Now to the last book!
