This was, at first, very confusing, I admit. But it was enjoyable, with different perspectives, narratives, styles, times...specially at the end, with a good message. Non traditional stories are always kinda fascinating. It makes me remember of authors and books I read in the past, such as **Hopscotch by Julio Cortazar**, or **"O Jogo da Amarelinha do Julio Cortazar"**, in portuguese. The version I read! They are incredible, but sometimes quite difficult...

As for this book, it took me a while to fully grasp everything - so it was a little overwhelming! Though, being short length, in time I could follow it a little better.

They are trying to terraform/colonize different worlds, galaxies, etc, with different versions/clones of themselves, and they are all fully aware of it. It's a great background, though I think it was kinda in the background, compared to the relationship stuff like the quote I mentioned here. For me, at least, that was the best part of the book.

It was a great read!
