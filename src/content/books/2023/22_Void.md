I loved this short story!! Made me think about how I love these kinds of stories... I find it super wonderful how tight
these stories can be, and still be compelling. Of course, being a short detective story doesn't exactly pose a "
mystery", it's all very predictable. But the setting! And the writing. A lot of potential here, and I def liked what I
read.

The Redundancy is a ship that makes interplanetary travels - but the way it works is almost detached of time. One of
the passengers we meet throughout the story is an old man, that was aboard the Redundancy when he was a kid. He
recognized our protagonist like she hadn't aged a day. It's timeless, like an open museum. It's a nifty and interesting
starting point, and I would love to read a full length novel in this setting.

The short story focuses more on the characters, the dilemmas they face and the issues that led them to the Redundancy.
It was very short, but sweet. It left me wanting for more, and I think that's the best I could wish for in a story such
as this!
