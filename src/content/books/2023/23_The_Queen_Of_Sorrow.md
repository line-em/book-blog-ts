So, I did it! I finished this trilogy. All in all, it was plenty fun! 😊

Basically, this book is focused on all the politics between 3 powerful women, each with their own personalities, loyalties and ambition. And this is great... It's not a very popular dynamic, and it made me smile to see it shine here!

> “I’m practical,” Merecot said. “Vast difference. Not everyone who is born is meant to survive. I have a responsibility to my people as a collective whole, not to any particular individual. But maybe that’s the difference between you and me. I value all my people equally. You cherish a few above all others. That’s why I’m a better queen than you are.”

> I never pretended to be a good queen, Naelin thought. But I’m better than Merecot.

I never liked the "romance", however, and I still don't like it here. It doesn't feel like it really adds anything to the story, and all the love interests could work as a friend/mentor role? It would certainly feel less awkward in some aspects. Ven as a love interest is such a wasted potential... Just blandly following Naelin wherever, without any agency whatsoever.

Some of my favorite relationship dynamics in this book are related to Garnah, but most specially, Merecot and Daleina. Friends? Enemies? Loyalty or deception? It's all very interesting - I understand that is not the choice opted for here, but if this book were to have any sort of attraction/romantical conflict plot, it would feel more interesting with this pairing. We're already _sold_ on Merecot and Daleina companionship and its complexities, and even if it didn't become true, because truly, it wouldn't work out, I think - it would feel more natural, and less like a "expected" consequence, like Hammon and Daleina, Ven and Naelin, and Arin and the new queen... The "attraction" appears in one conversation, and it's like it's now it's settled in stone...

Hammon is fine though... It's more like he is simply existing... but sometimes that's what it is? It just doesn't make much of a difference, though it helps explain Garnah's presence.... And Garnah is absolutelly necessary for this story, to my mind!

> “But as I understand it, for this to work it requires more than one powerful queen. It requires two: one to take power and one to give it. If this is to succeed, it won’t be because there’s never been another queen like Merecot. It will be because there’s never been a queen like you.”

Merecot and Garnah are marvellous, that kind of morally gray characters that makes books all the more interesting and delightful. You can never truly guess their actions. I also enjoyed Ven's family dynamics... What makes me think that the author really does enjoy her female characters, because they truly feel more unique and developed than the rest, even Ven. Hanna is also a force of nature. I love them all.

That being said... This book was way too convenient. At times slow and at times rushed. Naelin did some questionable things throughout the book, but it didn't have any repercussion (she affected the survivability of people of Aratay, but all is fine because she is Good Mother and etc etc). Ven blindly following her all the time without even questioning anything. At least Daleina does things on her own... And Merecot was admonished for her actions. I at least expected some kind of reprieve or something.

At the end, Daleina and Naelin didn't even see each other, each in their own place... it felt incomplete. I understand that the author wanted to wrap things up saying that life goes on. But it felt rushed through and through. Such an important relationship, and it's just waved upon, all the grievances and anxieties?

You know what could have worked? A short epilogue. At the end of the book, Daleina is musing about her wedding... What about a final gathering, a few months later, for that?. Merecot and the new Queen of Semo. Naelin, Bayn, and all the gang. All the new tensions and rivalries...

I don't know. Something to wrap up better than to each their own and their lives moved on...

All in all, I enjoyed these books a great deal. And it's rare a YA novel that focused so much on politics (and all by women!) and so little on romance. So props for that.

But the ending... Surely it could've been better.

> “But sorrow was an old friend by now, and she welcomed it in, embraced it, and then moved on to the business of being both freshly married and queen. Whatever mistakes she'd made, Aratay still needed her. Life goes on, and we live with our choices, she thought, and then smiled at herself, wondering when she'd become sanctimonious inside her own head. _Maybe for my next feat, I'll become a wise queen._
