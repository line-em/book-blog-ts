> “You don’t forget the face of the person who was your last hope.”

So, I decided to read this after watching The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes... Guess I'm reading it a few years later
than most people 😂 But well, curiosity got the better of me. Last book of the year! Woohoo! 😊

So, this was interesting! Funnily enough, I think I still like the movie slightly more, though I do appreciate some additions I only learned now that I've read the books. But that's where the fun is, right? Finding new content and all. 😊

> “My spirit. This is a new thought. I'm not sure exactly what it means, but it suggests I'm a fighter. In a sort of brave way. It's not as if I'm never friendly. Okay, maybe I don't go around loving everybody I meet, maybe my smiles are hard to come by, but i do care for some people.”

Things I liked include more details about the Capitol oppression and some extra gory stuff - which I understand why was left out of the movie, not only due to limited time and budget, but also because it could make it all heavier. For instance, the Avox, the traitors that get their tongues cut, and that Katniss already interacted with. The mutts, which are genetically engineered with the dead remains of the fallen tributes, and Cato's torture because it would give the Hunger Games higher ratings.

It is brutal.

It makes you hate the Capitol even more, which is, I guess, the whole idea! For me, it gave me some extra context I appreciated. The whole hunger games stuff is already brutal, in a way, so the movie works even without those things. Some other stuff that added context was the epilogue... We see Katniss and Peeta have the discussion that makes them grow apart at the end, and the whole coronation stuff that sets stuff up for the next book, Catching Fire. Also, I liked seeing more rebellious stuff right there, like Cinna making her look even more like a child after she won the games... While on the other hand, the Capitol wanting her to look older and sexier. And Katniss being fully aware of everything.

I said before, and I repeat - the movie is **awesome** even without those things, but I liked the extra context. Still, the movie is suberb and Jennifer Laurence is an amazing actress, def breathing more life into Katniss. What the movie has that this book lacks is different perspectives - and I admit, I would've liked to have more perspectives here.

Katniss is a wonderful heroine though, and regarding YA protagonists, she fits nicely into the better ones, I think! She has personality, backstory, and reasons for everything she does - and it doesn't always resolve around romance. Definitely a cool protagonist for young people to admire.

I admit that the first time I watched the movies, I didn't like Peeta much, nor their romance with Katniss. It seemed a bit forced - but in a way, the book made me realize, it **is** forced. One thing I liked from the books is that we can see Katniss conflicts better, the slow blossoming stuff, yes, but specially all the awkwardness. Katniss thinking that each kiss for the audience would get them gifts, for instance. It's not exactly natural. And Peeta seems through it, at the end.

> “One more time? For the audience?" he says. His voice isn't angry. It's hollow, which is worse. Already the boy with the bread is slipping away from me.

In the movies, we don't have the epilogue with their fight, and..... Can the actors be **too** good? 😂 That awkwardness is sorta lost, in a way. It feels their romance is more "real" than it really is. So yeah. Of course, Peeta's genuine.

> “You have a... remarkable memory."

All in all? I loved the ride. It simply works. There are some inconsistencies - some society stuff, the parachutes that somehow doesn't reveal their location, etc - but I'm willing to gloss over some of those. Though yeah, they exist, and they can damper the suspension of disbelief for a bit. The message is pretty clear though, and it was fun. In the end, that's what matters 💖
