Soooo! I guess reading this immediately after the first book + rewatching all the movies beforehand sorta stripped all the excitement from this book 🥲

Still, it's a nice follow-up, and the stakes kept (and keep) getting higher. It's funny to compare to what I thought about this book in the past... A story of revolution. Now I see that, although it portrays this theme, it's mostly a reflection on trauma/healing/humanity under extreme circumstances... in this case, a dystopia. The revolution and everything that leads up to that is part of this, but not the main thing.

> “My time in the arena made me realize how I needed to stop punishing [my mother] for something she couldn't help, specifically the crushing depression she fell into after my father's death. Because sometimes things happen to people and they're not equipped to deal with them.”

I like it when things hit differently depending on your age/circumstances and so on. Honestly, it speaks good things about the story, and that's one reason for my rating.

Another thing that strikes differently are the romances, I guess. I remember I fancied Gale more, back then - now, while I see the importance of their bond, I could easily see him as a true "cousin" or a friend. The romance, although not forced due to good writing, doesn't really add much. Symbolically it makes sorta sense though, but still, I see it as a product of its time: back when this book was released, love triangles were alllllll the rage. I'd be surprised if this wasn't a reason to include it.

> "Yeah, I guess so,” I said, But it’s not true. A mockingbird is just a songbird. A mockingjay is a creature the capitol never intended to exist. They hadn’t counted on the highly controlled jabberjay having the brains to adapt to the wild, to thrive in a new form. They hadn’t anticipated its will to live.”

I really do adore Peeta more this time around. Though, of course, relationships in general are complicated in this setting.

This was nice, though I kinda dragged a bit at certain parts. I will read Mockingjay, but I guess it's better if I wait a little more. I feel like rushing in - like I am doing right now - is not a good way to read this book. Any book, really.

> “But I feel as if I did know Rue, and she'll always be with me. Everything beautiful brings her to mind. I see her in the yellow flowers that grow in the Meadow by my house. I see her in the Mockingjays that sing in the trees. But most of all, I see her in my sister, Prim.”
