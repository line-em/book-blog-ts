So...... disappointing. I honestly believe that this one could be shorter. It's hard to justify it being 600 pages long.

This was a tough book to read. Too long, too repetitive, too much - in a lot of ways. Though, surprisingly, the ending was interesting enough that I am curious for the next book.

My main issue with this book was, unfortunately, its main characters and their relationship. Violet and Xaden were honestly really hard to swallow in this one, and considering how important they are to the story, it brought the whole thing down. Another thing is how dense it all was - too many new characters, dragons, etc, for me to know or care about. A lot of things are lost in the mix, and it's all due to sheer exaggeration, at least to me.

I buddy read this - and one thing we agree on is that this author is... not great with characters. I think the previous book was better in this regard - in most regards, really. But they felt specially flat here, and acted in ways that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

One particular case is related to the main character former best friend. Yes, she felt betrayed because he read her memories. However, she screamed at him the whole book without even an explanation. It was an annoying development - because he didn't even know the whole picture. But talking to him would be a reasonable action - and this book was *filled* to the brim with unreasonable actions.

Xaden and Violet are deeply unhealthy, period. They fought the whole book, and had sex at every opportunity, and never properly *talked* until the end. It was awful - "Ohhh, you didnt tell me! You didnt ask! But look at that hot ass...". This sums it up almost all interactions with them in the book, **ad infinitum**. So cringe-worthy. Such a lack of everything.

A lot of characters had missed potential. Brenan, her brother, Aaric, a prince or something?, and Sloane, the sister of Violet's deceased friend, are some examples. They could be so much more, but they were all forgettable. Instead, we got a lot of focus on Cat, Xaden's ex-girlfriend for extra drama, heightened emotions and jealousy.

Xaden lost most of his personality, though I'm getting kinda used to this in romance stories, though it's bad everytime... Nothing compares to Violet, and all his goals and motivations are second to Violet now.

Not to be all grim, I loved several scenes. Mostly the ones related to the dragons, and Liam's scenes - while Violet was being tortured, she'd imagine him and it was lovely. The ending was also great, with her mother's sacrifice and Xaden's fate (which I HOPE doesn't turn to another angst-snooze-fest in the next book).

The torture is another issue of mine: yes, a teacher could have a vendetta against her, and torture her... Mostly in secret, that would be fine. But having classes on being tortured, and torture being kinda accepted between the teachers, not being frowned upon at all? Totally mental to me.)

All in all..... I had such problems with this book, man. But the ending and the world seems interesting enough that I might try the following book. Don't know if I will hang on for 5 books though...

Honestly, too tired to write about my opinion... [So I will leave this Goodreads review here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5927048115). It sums up my opinions pretty well.
