> “I don’t deserve this,” she whispered. She felt like she was betraying her brother. Lieutenant Lark. The Sycamore Platoon. “I don’t deserve to be this happy. Not when there’s so much pain and terror and loss in the world.” “Why would you say that?” Roman replied, his voice gentle but urgent. “Do you think we could live in a world made only of those things? Death and pain and horror? Loss and agony? It’s not a crime to feel joy, even when things seem hopeless. Iris, look at me. You deserve all the happiness in the world. And I intend to see that you have it.”
> “Iris,” said Roman, “you are worthy of love. You are worthy to feel joy right now, even in the darkness. And just in case you’re wondering … I’m not going anywhere, unless you tell me to leave, and even then, we might need to negotiate.”

Oh, my. Such a beautiful book.

There's something special about letters, and I think this book captures this so, so well. Iris and Roman/Carver bond is delightfully woven in the novel, their connection and feelings and rivalries makes sense, and I felt like the author respected her readers. It's marvellous.

> “I don’t think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places. The way you hold someone’s hand as they grieve. The way you listen to others. The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”

This book is at once depressing and beautiful. It's set, mostly, on the front lines of the war. But there is light, in here. A tenderness and something poetic about how it is portrayed. It's still sad and heart-wrenching, at times. But there is a soft touch throughout. **War is often not what you expect**, they said. And it is true. There is humanity. And I guess that is what this is story was sorta about: finding light even in the darkest places.

All I want is to sprinkle a lot of quotes here.

> “I think we all wear armor. I think those who don’t are fools, risking the pain of being wounded by the sharp edges of the world, over and over again. But if I’ve learned anything from those fools, it’s that to be vulnerable is a strength most of us fear. It takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there’s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, “You will miss so much by being so guarded.” Perhaps it begins with one person. Someone you trust. You remove a piece of armor for them; you let the light stream in, even if it makes you wince. Perhaps that is how you learn to be soft yet strong, even in fear and uncertainty.
>
> One person, one piece of steel.”

I guess that's the thing. This... tenderness. This feeling of a tight hug, of showing their vulnerabilities, forging bonds, helping them, easing their pain and worries. Of complex bonds. Of fleeting relationships, and lasting memories. Of opening up yourself. I don't know - I'm not nearly as poetic as this book. But it makes you feel.

When Roman appeared while the siren was announcing an attack. Of a wedding before the invasion. Of the camaraderie in the trenches, despite the grim mornings. Of bravely fighting, or bravely deserting too. This book was full of heart, both in its main characters, but in its side characters oto. I loved it.

I want to leave here Iris first letter. Yes, not the most romantic. But gut-wrenching and beautiful and real. I couldn't stop reading afterwards.

> Every morning, when I wade through Mum’s sea of green bottles, I think of you. Every morning, when I slip into the trench coat you left behind for me, I wonder if you thought of me for even a moment. If you imagined what your departure would do to me. To Mum. I wonder if fighting for Enva is everything you thought it would be. I wonder if a bullet or a bayonet has torn through you. If a monster has wounded you. I wonder if you’re lying in an unmarked grave, covered in blood-soaked earth that I will never be able to kneel at, no matter how desperate my soul is to find you.
> I hate you for leaving me like this. I hate you, and yet I love you even more, because you are brave and full of a light that I don’t think I will ever find or understand. The call to fight for something so fervently that death holds no sting over you. Sometimes I can’t draw a full breath. Between my worry and my fear … my lungs are small because I don’t know where you are.
> It’s been five months since I hugged you goodbye at the depot. Five months, and I can only assume you are missing at the front or are too busy to write me. Because I don’t think I could rise in the morning—I don’t think I could get out of bed—if news came to me that you were dead. I wish you would be a coward for me, for Mum. I wish you would set down your gun and rend your allegiance to the goddess who has claimed you. I wish you would stop time and return to us.

The ending was dramatic and sad. I believe I have to read Ruthless Vows to heal my heart and decide what I feel about it!

But this book? Perfection. ❤️
