> “Everywhere Montgomery had been he’d spied the same misery under a different guise. In England it was in the factories, in Latin America it was in the fields. There was always someone with a little more money, a little more power, and he owned you.”

I read this almost at the same time as Divine Rivals, and as quickly as the other book. A travel thwarted by bad weather was a good sign for reading, I suppose XD

This book has good things, and bad things. Good thing: it is written beautifully, with lush descriptions. Bad thing: The slow pacing, sometimes the multiple POVs going back in time to show the same scene under different perspectives - which **can** be nice, but here, most of it didn't work to me. Good thing: A tale of growing up, learning about yourself. Finding strength. The romance is not the focus here. Bad thing: Despite everything, *our* bond with the characters was a bit shallow... At least mine was. And so on.

> “As Montgomery had said, what she wanted was not to be found at the bottom of a bottle, but she had no idea where it might be.”

So I feel a little conflicted. I like some things, and disliked others. 

I loved the backdrop of the story, in Yucatán, Mexico. It was immersive and there were good discussions about feminism and colonialism. The story sets place in a historical Mexico, contrasting a bit with the original source material. While I haven't read the classic, **The Island of Dr. Moreau**, I have a general idea about its themes and how it unfolds. Whereas the original focuses more on the horror and sci fi aspects, I feel like Silvia's approached focused more on **Magical Realism**. I can respect that choice, and given the author's strengths, I reckon this fits superbly.

But there were lacking aspects that would elevate this story. First, the pacing - it was very slow, and it focused too much on not-so-important things. Although there were 2 POVs, I think there is one that could be interesting enough, at least for one or two chapters: Lupe, or any hybrid. For a story that focused on the Dr. Moreau's creations, it felt like they were backdrops, a lot of times. It lacked more ethics and discussions, I think. The ending was exciting and engrossing - but it took too long to get there.

I really like the whole worldbuilding: the place the story settles in, the whole history surrounding it, the workers, the revolts, everything. The characters were interesting enough - the drunk but loyal Montgomery, and the naive Carlotta that grew claws and had to learn to become independent. But there was something that was missing. I can't say exactly what.

But it was a good reading, and the quality of it is great. But I had a few gripes, and it missed that "spark".
