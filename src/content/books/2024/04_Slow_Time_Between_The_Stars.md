Now I've pushed past 50% of **The Far Reaches** collection! Two more short stories to
go. [Void](/2023/22_Void) is still my favorite, however.

This one is pretty interesting, though. It all made sense, and it is very, very well-rounded.

An AI travels in order to restart humanity somewhere among distant start. It has stored memories and technologies about Earth and its humans, so it can complete its mission. Frequently, it rebuilds itself. Time moves slowly, and as the AI is not a living being, it can travel indefinitely, until it finds a suitable place.

But what is a suitable place, in the first place?

Though it never strayed from its mission, the AI went rogue. But it was all logical, merely it didn't _act_ the way humanity wanted, but it made sense through and through.

Humans wanted humanity to continue, and finding only a suitable place was enough. But not for the AI. Life could thrive in different ways in each planet, and it didn't want to disrupt a place's natural course. Instead, it opted to find willing and advanced lifeforms to accommodate the humans. It **is** an interesting thought. Time isn't a concern, nor is distance, for its nature is mechanical and forever. It makes perfect sense, to me.

The novel was on the slow side, though. Very interesting ideas and development, but I lacked more connection to the story.

Still, I enjoyed it a lot!
