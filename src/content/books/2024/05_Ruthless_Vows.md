> “Write me a story where there is no ending, Kitt. Write to me and fill my empty spaces.”

Good sequel... Though not as good as the first one. But still, a pretty nice follow up?

I liked that it developed more about the world. There were pretty nice scenes (a huge mention to chapter 35, if I'm not mistaken. So cute and wholesome, their date!). There were fewer letters, as the book became more grim. And I missed them, as I found them to be a highlight in the previous book.

> “Soon it would be night; the stars would pierce the sky like nails, and he would light the candles and write by fire because the words came easier in the darkness.”

I didn't particularly like a character death at the end. Though the book ended on a happier, sweeter note, for sure. But I would've liked that this character - _spoilers_ her brother - stayed alive.

> “The magic still gathers, and the past is gilded; I see the beauty in what has been but only because I have tasted both sorrow and joy in equal measures.”

Still, I love the main characters. Iris is so strong. I couldn't help but root for her and Kitt every step of the way. The minor characters are sweet, and overall, I like how their bond feels real and wholesome.

I didn't love all the ideas in this book, however. A third group - Graveyard - appeared, but their promise felt half-baked. Their rampage at the end of the book felt like too sudden, I barely knew them, their motives, anything! And it didn't serve much purpose, I feel.

I love the themes of healing and compassion, though. It feels hopeful and poetic, even in the middle of the war.

Overall, I enjoyed this. I had fun, the writing is great, and I felt happy the characters stood together by the end. Though, I'd prefer some things to be a little different.
