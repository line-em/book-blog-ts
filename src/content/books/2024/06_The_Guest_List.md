This one was entertaining, and fun. It has been a while since I read a whodunnit, and although some of the mysteries can be seen for a mile away, it was pretty solid.

It's fast-paced and gossipy, a lot of trouble and secrets brewing between the characters. They're all hiding something, and there's plenty of grievances to go around. I really couldn't stand the ushers though, but I guess that was intended - the pack mentality, "boys will be boys", etc. It always grates my nerves, but as I said, I think this was intended.

Some of the characters inner conflicts were interesting. They weren't exactly likeable, but you could understand their gripes, like Johnno and Olivia. All POV characters felt like they added a new layer and complexity to the story, so in general, I liked reading them.

> “Marriage is about finding that person you know best in the world. Not how they take their coffee or what their favourite film is or the name of their first cat. It's knowing on a deeper level. It's knowing their soul.”

The book develops in two timelines: the NOW, where a body has been found, and THEN, when the guests were arriving at the island, and all the drama started to brew. The twist is that you don't know who the body belongs to - and with so many troublesome guests, it could be anyone.

Although it was not revolutionary nor anything, it held its own and closed up well. I'd love for more epilogues though - we only get epilogues for two characters, and I'd love to hear what happened to more of them, specially Aoife and Freddy.

All in all, a quick and easy fun book!
