> “I expected the members of Earth’s leading society of villains to be smarter,” I said.

> “They would have to be, wouldn’t they?” Morrison said. “In the real world, they can be what people like them usually are: a bunch of dudes born into money who used that money to take advantage of other people to make even more money. It works great until they start believing that being rich makes them smart, and then they get in trouble. Unless they find someone else to take advantage of.”

This was definitely a fun ride! And I loved the ending, which is something I really do appreciate - I find most books the endings are ok at best?

It had a very different and kinda quirky premise, so I was quite intrigued. It's a fun, short, light book - nothing deep, or anything like that. But that was what drew me in! And I was quite surprised on how much I enjoyed this. The cats are simply fabulous!

> “I didn’t need another cat. At this point in my brilliant career as an itinerant educator I could barely afford to feed myself. But then, no one ever needs a cat these days. That’s not why we have cats. We have cats because they amuse us and because otherwise our clothes would lack the texture only cat hair can provide.”

There is also some commentary - on labor unions, weird tech bros, animal treatment, billionaires, ethics, so there is some criticism in face of the current state of the world. I find those are some of my favorite kinds of books - though they are light, they offer a lot of food for thought.

And well, this book _is_ quite light and witty. Our protagonist inherits his uncle's business, after his death - but it comes with a lot of strings attached, weird experiments, crazy billionaires, talking dolphins and crazy plans. It's never boring.

> “Instead I’m here on an island in the Caribbean, being told I need to talk to the dolphins in the middle of a labor action about some whales that might have torpedoes, armed by a secret society of villains who want access to a storeroom full of objects probably looted from the victims of the friggin’ Nazis and who are maybe willing to blow up my volcano lair to get it.”

By the end (spoilers!), things do calm down, and our protagonist gets a happy ending is with his cats. Adorable!

> “Sounds risky.”

> I’M A CAT, I CAN HANDLE RISK. WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS I LOSE EVERYTHING AND I STILL GET FED AND HAVE A PLACE TO NAP.

> “That’s … a surprisingly chill way of thinking about things.”

> SOMETIMES IT’S BETTER NOT TO BE A HUMAN, CHARLIE.”
