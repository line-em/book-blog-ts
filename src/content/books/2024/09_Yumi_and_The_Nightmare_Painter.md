> “Why do we tell stories?
>
> They are a universal human experience. Every culture I’ve ever visited, every people I’ve met, every human on every planet in every situation I’ve seen…they all tell stories.
>
> Men trapped alone for years tell them to themselves. Ancients leave them painted on the walls. Women whisper them to their babies. Stories explain us. You want to define what makes a human different from an animal? I can do it in one word or a hundred thousand. Sad stories. Exultant stories. Didactic morality tales. Frivolous yarns that, paradoxically, carry too much meaning. We need stories.”

This was... fantastic. And as someone who enjoys and makes art - this resonated so much with me. From what I could gather, this book was inspired by a lot of Japanese media - like FFX (which I **love**) and Your Name. And it feels like it! Not only because the scenery looks like modern-day Japan and old Korea, the cozy ramen shops, etc. But the reflections about meditation, creation, and so on...

This is a love letter to many things I hold dear. And speaks true of many emotions I've felt - sadness, deppression, loneliness, and others, with such a real way. It feels deeply relatable. And warm, cozy and nice like a warm cup of tea.

> “Trauma doesn’t decrease with company, but it does grow easier to work through when you know someone else understands.”

> “But she just felt…tired. And guilty over her lack of proper emotions.
> And more tired, because guilt of that sort is an immense burden. Heavier than the rocks she’d moved earlier.
> Then she felt ashamed. Because guilt has a great number of friends and keeps their addresses handy for quick summons.”

I don't know what else to say - I just felt this book real deeply. The last few chapters were pretty emotional, the body-swapping awkwardness was so sweet, the revelations felt so right.

To be honest, I felt the descriptions of the magic system could be confusing - it's all Cosmere stuff, but it may feel a little odd if you're not familiar with the intrincasies of the universe crafted by Sanderson. It doesn't interfere in the least in the main story and themes though - so I feel it's all right to read it even if you're not used to it.

> “But then again, there’s nothing intrinsically valuable about any kind of art. That’s not me complaining or making light. It’s one of the most wonderful aspects to art—the fact that people decide what is beautiful. We don’t get to decide what is food and what is not. (Yes, exceptions exist. Don’t be pedantic. When you pass those marbles, we’re all going to laugh.) But we absolutely get to decide what counts as art. If Yumi’s people wanted to declare that rock arrangements surpassed painting or sculpture as an artistic creation…well, I personally found it fascinating. The spirits agreed.”

Still, this was marvellous. I will still gush about this book and its incredible art for a long time, probably!

> “This was art. Something the machine, however capable in the technical details, could never understand. Because art is, and always has been, about what it does to us. To the one shaping it and the one expe- riencing it.”
