I found out about this book due to the Ghibli movie - which I unsurprisingly adore! So I
guess it can't be helped that I kinda did compare the two - though, it is important to
notice that while they **do** share a lot of things - they are very, _very_ different,
specially
from the second half of the book onwards.

What I liked about the book was that there were a lot more context on the magic and
characters, though I do think the whimsical nature of the movie works quite well too! The
Witch of the West is completely another character, and Sophie's family plays a bigger role
in the story! As does Howl's story and past, and Sophie's magic gift. And all of it does
add a lot of amazing detail.

Though it took me a while to get me engaged - and I sorta expected more interactions with
Howl
and Sophie. I loved the ending banter - but I felt there could be a bit more of it to
cement their relationship better. And I did find their initial encounter a little odd
here - I
vastly prefer the animated version, though it does get too romantic too early also, so...

Still, it was a lighter reading that I enjoyed!
