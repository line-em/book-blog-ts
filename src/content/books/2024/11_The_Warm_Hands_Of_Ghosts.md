This book took me a while to get into, I will not lie - however, once things started to get interesting, it went very fast!

It starts slow, while we accompany Laura, a field nurse that is back home due to WWI injuries. That's when she starts getting mixed signals about her brother's fate, and sets out again to the warzone.

We get two perspectives in this book - and the other one follows her brother, but a few months in the past (at least initially). I tend to like multiple perspectives, specially if it's done well, and this one was great.

This novel is about, according to a review I read and agree, "enduring love between siblings, unexpected connections, and sacrifices made to maintain the most tenuous hold on "safety" for those they care about."

It brings a touch of fantasy to the grim reality, in the figure of the fiddler (the Devil), bringing oblivion amidst the harsh reality.

> And you will tell me everything. Every night. What you love. What you hate. And why you're afraid. Until you remember nothing at all.

The ending was nice - maybe with a few too many coincidences and a huge stoke of luck, but it works. The romance is very light, due to the whole grim plot, and the ending focuses more on recovery, healing, and trauma. I think it fits the story.

All in all, I enjoyed this!

PS: Love the title of the book to bits.
