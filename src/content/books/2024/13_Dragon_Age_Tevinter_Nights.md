Various tales from a world I missed, and that I'm pretty eager to get back to (Dragon Age). So this was a super reading for me! Making me feel like a little detective, getting more pieces from years of lore, and feeling a few years younger too.

I can't wait for the next game, DA: Veilguard, and this book definitely made my hype grow ü§£

What I loved is that these short stories really flesh out a multitude of places and factions throughout the world, and that is fantastic. It feels like it's even more alive, with multiple things set in motion, occurring all over the place. I loved it.

**Here's some of my favorite tales:**
* **The Horror of Hormak:** Grey wardens descend a unknown thaig, and discover many many important stuff related to the elven gods. There is body horror, but the lore was fantastic.
* **Eight Little Talons:** Possibly my favorite in the book. The follow a Antivan Crow's meeting, with all their highest ranking members (the Talons). Here we follow a series of murders and intrigue that happens in the far off mansion the story takes place, clearly an homage to Agatha Christie! But what sold me on this was the dynamic between the two main characters, they had an incredible chemistry and it was pretty fun to read.
* **The Wigmaker:** I got to know one of the companions we will have in the game, and I loved him! We follow him track his mark, a Tevinter Altus (high ranking mage) that is doing pretty cruel stuff. Lucanis is emotive - so he "frees" the slaves as best he can, and enacts revenge.
* **The Dread Wolf Take You** - Possibly one of the most important stories regarding the next game. Here we follow a meeting with several individuals - a Carta Assassin, an Executor, a Mortalitasi, an Orlesian Bard, etc - which is pretty secret, meant to update each other on the movings of the Dread Wolf. The tales are great, while we get to follow Solas going after the Red Lyrium Idol from DA2, and how he is acting - and becoming feared - all around Thedas. But, spoilers ahead! He was the Orlesian Bard all along, disguised. The petrifies the attendees in the end, but saves the Inquisition representative (Charter) that figured out who he was. He left, leaving a messing for the Inquisitor.

> He smiled sadly. ‚ÄúI know that feeling well. I am not a god, Charter. I am prideful, hotheaded, and foolish, and I am doing what I must. When you report back to the Inquisitor . . .‚Äù His voice faltered. ‚ÄúSay that I am sorry.‚Äù

**The ones I had most fund**
* **Herold Had the Plan** - Fun, and with a heart of gold, I'd say! We follow a heist gone wrong with the Lords of Fortune, and while they're trying to escape, they get tangled with yet another trouble... The ending is beautiful and tragic, and must be one of my favorite endings per se (alongside The Dread Wolf Take You).
* **And Old Crow's Old Tricks** - This one may not make much sense (the biggest culprit being the last mark), when I think about it, but it was entertaining! We follow an older crow enact their assassination towards a racist Tevinter centauri, that destroyed an entire Dalish village. The tone is not very heavy, because of the protagonist!


**Some important mentions**: 
* **Callback** - Getting back to Skyhold, and meeting a new kind of spirit that might be relevant! This was a bit nostalgic and melancholic.
* **Luck in the Gardens** - Dorian's tale, and a Lord of Fortune which was a great, unreliable narrator! We also meet an interesting new foe.
* **The Streets of Minrathous** - Neve's tale, a companion who will appear next game. It was very fun, and I loved meeting her. She is a private investigator, and bit by bit, we unveil a dangerous plot regarding the Venatori.
* **Half Up Front** - Here we follow a WxW couple doing some thievery. However, it turned out to be a fluke, and we realize this was a job from one of the Dread Wolf's agents all along. In the end, the couple is sent to meet Varric!
* **Hunger**: Werewolves!

These are not all the stories, though - but the ones I enjoyed the most, one way or another.


> "Her Divine Victoria,
you who have served are to be commended.
And though the Herald guides you no more,
and legion and name are retired,
know that you served good and true.
Change comes, both to and because of the Inquisition.
And we are blessed with the ability to accept and move on,
to leave dread and regret behind.
Know that Skyhold remains, its fires bright.
Forevermore it is where you are from, not where you are bound.
Attempt no travel there.
Let the past guide you to a new direction.
And be well.‚Äù
