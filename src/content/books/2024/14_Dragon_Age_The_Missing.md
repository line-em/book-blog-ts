Maybe this is officially a **Dragon Age Summer**? ðŸ¤£

This one wasn't exactly remarkable though, although it definitely sets up the next game. It began interesting enough - my problem with it is that its _main_ purpose is to set the new game, not to hold on its own two feet, in my mind?

I mean. It ends by referencing that they need someone _new_ - someone _new_ meaning our next protagonist in the game.

So yet. Although it had potential, it fell a little short for me. Still, I got really interested in a few locations, like the **Arlathan Forest**!
