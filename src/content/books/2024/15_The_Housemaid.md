I read a review that mentioned this was a **popcorn thriller**, and I guess this summarizes my feelings a little bit! This is not exactly complex or profound - but somehow it keeps you glued to the screen/book.

An ex-convict starts working on a rich mansion, with people that seems unstable and weird at best. She is (sorta) alarmed when the gardener starts to say "Peligro", although she fears he doesn't know much english. From then onwards, we follow her days there, until a major development, where we start seeing multiple POVs and start getting the full story.

The ending is a little too "happy", like, things just aligned themselves a bit too neatly. Though the tension was interesting.

I read it pretty quickly, as I read it in a bus ride - so it's fun enough and perfect for the moment! And I can see the appeal and why it is popular.

Not my favorite by any means, but it fulfilled its purpose!
