This book is actually a re-read - and one I slightly struggle to remember _why_ exactly I made a re-read, as it was sort of a impulse decision. I can gather 3 thoughts that breezed on my mind on and off in the meanwhile:
- I heard some comments about the ball scene (that I barely remembered), and I wanted to see what I missed the first time around.
- There's two characters I'm curious about their whereabouts and shenaningans, but I needed context to get there.
- I wanted a light book that wouldn't stress me out too much.

And well, fair enought, I suppose? So I gave it a re-read. And even though I didn't write about Truthwitch here, last I checked (it was earlier than my first entries), as I went through the pages I realized I felt the same way about it as I felt a few years ago, when I first went through this.

_I don't care about the main character_. And to top it up, _I don't exactly like her LI_. Which makes reading this book... a struggle.

Yes, the ball scene is cool, now that I went through it again - the two romantic leads kinda have an antagonistic beginning, and as they challenge each other _sparks fly_. But as soon as they open their mouths, I get back to not liking them again... And after this first scene, the others weren't as nice. The sheer amount of times they fell on each other and so on, for instance... Not exactly a fan? And they're were both too moody, too impulsive, too too much all the time. Having bad traits is normal, but most of the time they both felt mostly tiresome and cartoonish.

I _do_ like Safiya's threadsister, however. Iseult is plenty cool and full of mysteries that I feel eager to know more. The monk, Aeduan, the Bloodwitch, is also pretty interesting the second time around.

What sucks is, I already abandoned the following book, **Windwitch**, once. I may not have been at my best or I dunno, but it didn't grab me exactly. And I also _know_ things pick up with the characters I'm interested in only in the third (!) book! So, the question, and point that remains is... Will I be able to keep up with the series for so long, knowing I already gave up once?

Well. I will try, I suppose, now that I ventured through Truthwitch again. I just hope, contrary to this book, in which my feelings remained the same in the second read-through, that Windwitch fares _better_ for me now. So let's hope!

Next in line though, is Last Flight, which I sorta postponed so I'd read it closer to Dragon Age: The Veilguard release. So I may pick up Windwitch afterwards.

Without further ado though, let's keep reading! üôè
