This one was quite interesting, even if it took me agesss to read!

> “Perhaps there's some truth to the idea that the real danger of blood magic isn't that it draws the power from sacrifice, or that it tempts the greedy and ambitious into using the suffering of others to fuel their spells. Perhaps the danger is simply that we do not understand it, and that lack of understanding invites disaster even when our intentions are pure.”

It followed two timelines, the one from the past more interesting, however. Though I liked how both timelines connected at the end!

It follows a young mage rediscovering a secret journal at the Grey Warden's base. It follows a blood mage on the 4th Blight, and what happened to the griffons in Thedas, a race that's gone extinct.

> “One thing we were taught as templars is that, in moments of doubt, you must always give people the opportunity to do good. Sometimes they surprise you. Sometimes they don't."
> "Which one's the surprise?"
> Now it was the templar's turn to offer a small, unfinished smile, barely visible in the dark. "That anyone ever actually gives someone else the chance.”

I really liked knowing more about the griffons, though it was very sad by the end. But following how hard and agonizing the blight was, the costs, how it all unveiled... It was great.
