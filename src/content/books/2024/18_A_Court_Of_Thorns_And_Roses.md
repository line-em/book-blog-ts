So... I've finally read it, I guess?

It's been so many years hearing about this book. I didn't exactly think I was going to like it (having abandoned the Throne of Glass series by the same author), but I've grown increasingly _curious_ about it.

So I finally caved, I guess?

And I wasn't really surprised by my reaction: a huge _meh_. Since then I've heard the second book is better, Let's see if I can get curious enough to try it soon...

The book was very slow paced. The interaction of the main characters were very predictable - and the main character didn't exactly behave like a huntress for a long time. People gave her advice, she ignored. "Don't go out, it's dangerous", and then "Well, let's have a midnight snack", for instance. As someone who _draws/paints_, the depiction of someone who likes to paint feels a little shallow as well. Like, just a fake adornment to make the MC seem cooler.

The plot itself is strange. For most of the book it seems odd (she killed someone from his court, and then, as punishment, Tamlin brings her to live a life of luxury at his court?), and after the explanation / lore dump of the whole reason behind it, it _sorta_ gets explained, as a curse... But it's so _oddly_ specific, it feels too convenient! And too convoluted, somehow.

The book picks up at the ending with the trials, and gets more interesting. Though it quickly ends afterward.

Of course, the ending is also weird because of the riddle and stuff - why would a super "evil" and intelligent Fae throw all her luck in a simple riddle? "She doesn't play games she won't win", and then she makes a riddle about love...

I had a friend who told me that the world had potential but it never really delivered. I'm still on the first book, granted, but that's sort of what I feel too.
