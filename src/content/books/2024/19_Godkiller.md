> ‘You care for her, don’t you?’ he said.
Kissen shifted and rubbed her chin, clearly uncomfortable with being noted for vulnerabilities. ‘I was a lost little girl once,’ she said after a moment, touching her chest. ‘No one deserves to be alone in this world.’
Elo resisted the temptation to reach out and touch her arm, to tell her that he was also lost, also alone. So alone it hurt.
‘I want to help her,’ Kissen shrugged and said. ‘I’m scared for her.’ Then she smiled crookedly. ‘Now, I’m a little scared of her.’

> To her, Skedi had been her companion, her friend. Others saw him as a god. Something to be frightened of. But Skedi didn’t want people to be frightened of him, he wanted to be loved. He wanted to survive, more than anything, and he had just put himself at risk for her. Because … he loved her, and despite it all, she loved him too.
‘I will try to forgive you‘, she said to him.

> ‘You were willing to kill to help her …’
‘I was tricked.’
‘That’s by the by; it’s the killing I want, not the excuses.’
Elo surprised himself by laughing. He liked her. It had been a while since he spoke to someone so willing to meet him where he was, as he was. Ex-knight, full of secrets, full of terror.


> “Gods began as spirits, drawn to places where people travelled and might need them. One day, they might gather enough willpower to blow dust on the road in the right direction for home or cause a thief’s bow to misfire at the perfect moment. Then, someone might give thanks, give offerings, give them shape. Even when their shrine is gone, their power can linger. A shrine is like the keel of a ship; it holds them together.”

> “Funerals are for the living," said Kissen as she noticed Inara looking. "The dead don't mind what the world does to them.” 


> “You are worth more than you think. You are still alive; make something of it. Of life, not death.”
