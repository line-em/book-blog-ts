> ‘You care for her, don’t you?’ he said.
> Kissen shifted and rubbed her chin, clearly uncomfortable with being noted for vulnerabilities. ‘I was a lost little girl once,’ she said after a moment, touching her chest. ‘No one deserves to be alone in this world.’
> Elo resisted the temptation to reach out and touch her arm, to tell her that he was also lost, also alone. So alone it hurt.
> ‘I want to help her,’ Kissen shrugged and said. ‘I’m scared for her.’ Then she smiled crookedly. ‘Now, I’m a little scared of her.’

This was plenty of fun - specially _after_ the second half! The first half a little bit slow and I took a while to warm up to the setting and characters.
Once things started to get going, however... It was incredible!

We're thrown out in this weird and unique fantasy world, where gods can be everywhere, in all shapes and sizes, and somehow very involved in people's lives. I guess this quote explains it better:

> “Gods began as spirits, drawn to places where people travelled and might need them. One day, they might gather enough willpower to blow dust on the road in the right direction for home or cause a thief’s bow to misfire at the perfect moment. Then, someone might give thanks, give offerings, give them shape. Even when their shrine is gone, their power can linger. A shrine is like the keel of a ship; it holds them together.”

> “Gods are not always the enemy; even your godkiller knows that. People make gods, and, for better or worse, gods make people. We show each other for what we truly are. Yearning beings, desperate for love, power, safety.”

It feels pretty unique! Took me some while to fully grasp its intricacies, so I sorta think this is both a boon and a bane. Edging towards a boon at the last half.

We start following Kissen, a godkiller (and namesake of this book!), when she encounters Inara Craier, a noble kid that somehow god entangled with a god of white lies. Due to a terrible incident, she starts taking care of the girl to resolve this problem while saving her life. In the meanwhile (it takes a while), we meet a baker/knight, Elogast, that joins their party and honestly, I loved his POVs! Tortured but kind, dependable but gullible. Skediceth - the god of white lies - and their little manipulations (but with a sprinkle of warmth and feeling) was my favorite character though, I love morally grey characters that _feel_ things and makes mistakes. They were all great in their own ways though, and Kissen made me remember of a character from a friend of mine (Emi). 🫶

The world, as I said, is fascinating. It is also very queer, even though not all couple _are_ queer. But it is very present and I like it! Kissen also has a disability - and I liked how it was portrayed. The bond between the characters - the betrayals, the half-truths, and the ultimately found family they became is very endearing. Found family is one of my favorite tropes, so it really ressonated with me.

> To her, Skedi had been her companion, her friend. Others saw him as a god. Something to be frightened of. But Skedi didn’t want people to be frightened of him, he wanted to be loved. He wanted to survive, more than anything, and he had just put himself at risk for her. Because … he loved her, and despite it all, she loved him too.
> ‘I will try to forgive you‘, she said to him.

I have a lot of good things to talk about this book! Though, mostly, about the second half. The first half is not _bad_ per se, but for such a small book, I thought it took a while to set things in motion. Though the payoff was great.

> ‘You were willing to kill to help her …’
> ‘I was tricked.’
> ‘That’s by the by; it’s the killing I want, not the excuses.’
> Elo surprised himself by laughing. He liked her. It had been a while since he spoke to someone so willing to meet him where he was, as he was. Ex-knight, full of secrets, full of terror.

Starting from the **spoilers!** trickery Skedi throws on Inara, possessing her body and twisting too many _lies_, I couldn't stop! The conversations and intimacy and conflict felt very, very nice, and I was super engrossed.

> “Funerals are for the living," said Kissen as she noticed Inara looking. "The dead don't mind what the world does to them.”

What will the future books bring, I don't know - the next one is named after Elogast, and the last, I think, for Inara? It will only release next year though, so I might wait a little before reading the next book.
