_En: The Prince and the Dressmaker_

This one was **ADORABLE**. And also terribly short. But awesome and pretty and tender. I loved it!

I guess there are stories that comics make it all the more sweeter. The bond between the two leads, the family acceptance, pursing their dreams and accepting their own self. And the art makes it all the more enchanting, the pastel colors, the cute lineart, and so on.

I wanted to read this for a _long_ time, and I got deeply in love with the brazilian version by Darkside. That's why I couldn't bring myself to read the english version, for some reason! I _had_ to read it in portuguese. It fit: it made it more light-hearted, in a way - reason I also enjoy reading Thursday's Murder Club in portuguese as well.

It was all I had imagined! ❤️
Although shorter than I thought. But the feelings and warmth are there 2455151%!
