> “I could say these unfiltered things to him because he didn’t care. Wes Bennett knew what a mess I was underneath it all, and there was a little bit of joy in knowing he saw the real me. Freedom.”

This one felt _so_ much like those movies I watched when I was a teen. I guess that is kinda the vibe it wanted, however, so it more than delivered, in a sense!

It was very sugary. Still, I read it in mostly one sitting, knowing _exactly_ what would happen, but excited to see it in front of my eyes anyway! It made me remember The Princess Diaries and sweet romcoms that I don't watch since a looooooong long time! There's some _odd_ satisfaction to these kinds of stories. I don't necessarily reach for them too often, but yeah. It's _odd_, but nice. I'm not really articulate I guess, but what I mean to say is that it was enjoyable!

Nothing new, however. But it does deliver what it promises, and it made me happy!
Being YA, however, I felt like there were a lot of "lessons", like, family lessons, friendship and romance lessons, lying and forgiving, growing, grief... But it was fine. It's very _safe_ in a way, so I guess even younger people can read no problem, I guess 🤗

> “Hey, kiddo.” Helena looked over at me from the doorway that led to the kitchen as I practiced piano in the living room. I liked playing in the morning, and I liked playing in my fancy flowered pajamas with the matching silk slippers. It made practicing feel like an elegant pastime, like I was an erstwhile Austen character honing one of the skills that would make me a fearsome thing to behold.”

But I guess, bottom line, I like the banter between the two leads. Even if the ending was a cheesy mess of miscommunication, most of the book had really fun banter!

> “She’s pretty, but her face doesn’t transform into sunlight when she talks about music.” He did that clench thing with his jaw and said, “She’s funny, but not spit-out-your-drink-in-astonishment funny.” It felt like my heart was going to explode as his eyes moved down to my lips under the glow of the buzzing streetlight. He moved his face a little closer to mine, looked into my eyes, and rumbled, “And when I see her, I don’t feel like I have to talk to her or mess up her hair or do something—anything—to get her to swing that gaze on me.”
