This one felt _so_ much like those movies I watched when I was a teen. I guess that is kinda the vibe it wanted, however, so it more than delivered, in a sense!

It was very sugary. Still, I read it in mostly one sitting, knowing _exactly_ what would happen, but excited to see it in front of my eyes anyway!
