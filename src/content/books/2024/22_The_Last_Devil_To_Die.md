> “Days of death are days when we weigh our relationship with love in our bare hands. Days when we remember what has gone, and fear what is to come. The joy love brings, and the price we pay. When we give thanks but also pray for mercy.” 

This book was sweet and sad. As always, I found the mystery to be on the lackluster side (I was suspecting the correct culprits for half the book), but where this book shines is on the characters, their relationships, etc. And this part was very, very good in this entry. ❤️

I find a lot of joy in the characters, specially Joyce’s POV. It all feels very tender. I also love the community as a whole - they have the “Bob of the computers”, they found a way to celebrate New Years’ Eve in time for a good night’s sleep, and so on. A lot of nice little things like that that put a smile on my face! There are a lot o quips and interactions like those. The brevity and light-hearted interactions, I think, is what makes this truly cozy, and lessens the weight that a book such as this could have. Specially  this one.

> “Everyone who dies is alive. We call people "dead" because we need a word for it, but "dead" just means that time has stopped moving forward for that person? You understand? No one dies, not really.”
> (...)
> “We think time travels forward, marches on in a straight line, and so we alongside it to keep up. Hurry, hurry, mustn't fall behind. But it doesn't, you see. Time just swirls around us. Every thing is always present. The things we've done, the people we've loved, the people we've hurt, they're all still here.”

This one has darker moments. And I’m glad this wasn’t rushed, wasn’t hand waved, and so on. Spoilers ahead: Stephen dies in this book. And it’s very, very sad. We get a few of his POVs - how he’s handling the Alzheimer, how it impacts his mind, how he and Elizabeth are struggling.... It’s painful. The mortality and death discussions arise here - and of course, with a main cast of elderly people, they have all thought about it, and grieved, a lot.

> “And Stephen had still chosen her? Stephen had made her, that was the truth. Had glued her together. And here she lies. Unmade. Unglued.”
> (...)
> “How will life go on now? How is that possible? She hears a car on a distant road. Why on earth is anybody driving? Where is there to go now? Why is the clock in the hall still ticking? Doesn’t it know it stopped days ago?”

This part in particular made me heart clench. It hit me hard. It was very well written, and it makes me remember why I love this series: it’s endearing, sweet, but it also finds a way to speak true about things we usually don’t want to talk about, death, getting older, how to deal with all of this. I felt a lot of sadness throughout the book: there are a lot of funerals , and they hurt.

> “Had she really understood then that those were the best of times? That she was in heaven? She thinks she did understand, yes. Understood she had been given a great gift. Doing the crossword in a train carriage, Stephen with a can of beer ("I will only drink beer on trains, nowhere else, don't ask me why"), glasses halfway down his nose, reading out clues. The real secret was that when they looked at each other, they each thought they had the better deal.”

It starts with Stephen’ friend death. Then the little pet fox that everyone on the community took care (and gave different names!), and then, lastly, Stephen. I felt this book was a lot more emotive and filled with sad moments, instead of a pure mystery novel. The mystery is totally on the backseat for me, and could easily be forgotten.

Apparently, the book series will continue eventually... To be honest, I’m quite happy with what we’ve got so far, so for me, this seems like a good ending. I wouldn’t mind if the series stopped here, but let’s see what’s in store for the future. However, if I ever pick up any sequels, it will be like meeting old friends again.

> “They say that time softens the pain, but that’s a fairy tale. Who would ever love again if anyone actually told the truth? I’m afraid there are some days when I could still rip out my own heart and weep myself hollow for Gerry. Some days? Every day.”

I love these characters. The mysteries, unfortunately, not so much! But still, I think this book as whole lotta of heart, and that’s what always makes me come back to this universe.

> “But, however much life teaches you that nothing lasts, it is still a shock when it disappears. When the man you love with every fibre starts returning to the stars, an atom at a time.”
