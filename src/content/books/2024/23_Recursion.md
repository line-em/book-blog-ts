Alright... Let's begin by saying I was really excited about this book, and its writer. I believe I will give him a second chance with Dark Matter, however.

I have a little bit to unpack. This book started out fascinating for me, and I kept talking to people about it. It begins as our detective tries to prevent a woman from killing herself from a tall building. And why was she there? _Well_, there had been an influx of people suffering from the False Memory Syndrome. She remembered a whole life that wasn't real. A kid she didn't have. With a man she _tracked_ and wasn't warm with her like in her memories - but barely remembered her. The pain was unbearable, and she jumped.

Later, the detective reads that this woman was in fact _saved_. What was happening, exactly? Thus, he starts to investigate the cause for this syndrome.

On the other POV, we follow a scientist that wants to build some technology that could save her mother's memories, who is developing Alzheimer. From the get-go, despite being from different years, we kinda suspect those two stories will match, eventually. How? Well, I guess it depends on the person!

The book is full of its twists and turns, and some of them are really enjoyable. I also like the Epilogue. Ending that way felt like it was both for our imagination to complete, like for a cycle to repeat, and I thought it was fabulous.

The problem for me? The middle of the book, I suppose. It got **very** tiring, and it took me a while to smudge through. _Too much_ happens, and by the end, I don't even know if the solution to their conundrum made sense or not, I just wanted to finish it I guess?

Well, from here onwards, I will dredge into spoiler territory! This book is, in fact, a time travel book. While researching memories, Helena, our scientist, stumbles upon a time machine: upon imprinting a very strong memory, and having a near-death experience, you can travel to the memory you recorded, while having full control and being able to create another timeline. The first one we experience is from the detective's POV: He goes back to the past and prevents his daughter from dying.

However, here comes a caveat: when the timelines reach the same "point", people will remember what happened in previous timelines. It can be shocking - in the case of the detective's daughter, after she remembers literally dying, she couldn't cope and killed herself.

While this was... in a lesser scale, I guess it worked better for me. However, it turned world dangerous real quick - and while it made sense, it felt very draining. I knew the characters wouldn't die - they'd just go back in time. And everytime people would recover their memories to bad and expected consequences, they were conveniently away from the tech that would send them back in time. And they always _knew_ when it would happen, because our main characters spend most of the book in a loop trying to prevent this whole tech to even being created.

So, this felt at the same time like too much, and too repetitive. There were good glimpses and good parts throughout. One instance for me is the whole timeline in which Helena had died. She pain and effort finally catching up to her, and the whole connection and desperation that surrounded them.

But yeah. In a way, this was a bit of a letdown. It mixed a lot of things I enjoy, had a really strong beginning - but ultimately, failed to grip me.
