Ending the year with a **blast** of a book! 🎉🥳
I really enjoyed this one! Some minor complaints about the ending, which I will get to in a bit... But other than that? I enjoyed this one a lot!
I believe this is one of these books that could work really well with Book Clubs also - like The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Gossip! Drama! Morally grey characters! Critique and satire! So much good stuff. It talks a lot about the literary world, and, specially, **who should tell a story?**

> “For the first time since I submitted the manuscript, I feel a deep wash of shame. This isn’t my history, my heritage. This isn’t my community. I am an outsider, basking in their love under false pretenses. It should be Athena sitting here, smiling with these people, signing books and listening to the stories of her elders.”

The book starts with our protagonist, June, meeting with Athena, her successful writer friend for a girl's night out - until her sudden demise. In the midst of all the panic of seeing her die - and all the complex relationship dynamics they have -, June steals her friend's manuscript, edits it, and releases the book for all to see.

> "The hardest part is keeping track of all the characters. We change almost a dozen names to reduce confusion. Two different characters have the last name Zhang, and four have the last name Li. Athena differentiates them by giving them different first names, which she only occasionally uses, and other names that I assume are nicknames (A Geng, A Zhu; unless A is a last name and I’m missing something), or Da Liu and Xiao Liu, which throws me for a loop because I thought Liu was a last name, so what are Da and Xiao doing there? Why are so many of the female characters named Xiao as well? And if they’re family names, does that mean everyone is related? Is this a novel about incest? But the easy fix is to give them all distinct monikers, and I spend hours scrolling through pages on Chinese history and baby name sites to find names that will be culturally appropriate."

It's a story of plagiarism, but it isn't so simple. June is a complex character, as is Athena. For as though she dies in the first pages in the book, her presence lingers. The book that June stole? It is _success_. A haunting, huge success. June is not the same afterwards - and the ghost of Athena will follow her to the end. The book is so successful, it raises the fear of being discovered, as well as shining light in dozens of critiques here and there - about racism, the industry, the solitude, and so on. For instance, June, our protagonist, signed her first book as June _Hayward_. However, now that she is on a new "chapter" of her career, writing stories about the Chinese - well, why not call her Juniper _Song_? "We can always say it's a new name for a new era".

The book also has a lot of social media in it - and the envy, culture wars, and all that jazz. However, I find that the heart of it - and its biggest strength, is with June and Athena. June steals from Athena, for sure - and the envy clouds her judgement quite a bit. She asks herself, sometimes, if she should be the one to tell a Chinese story. Most of the time, though, she doesn't really mind at all, it's _so fortunate_ she's here to tell this tale, when no one else could. However - what about Athena? As much as she is painted as a "hero", and, sometimes, "better" than June, we also learn (spoilers) that Athena also steals stories from other people, in her own way. And the story she stole from June is so intimate, it hurts too. The book does not condone plagiarism, of course, and throughout the book we're left with the sensation that, sooner or later, _something_ will happen to June. But still, bits like this gives a lot of nuance, and they're peppered in the pages. I liked it a lot.

June and Athena friendship/rivalry is very well written.

> “Every time she tried to branch out to new projects, they kept insisting that Asian was her brand, was what her audience expected. They never let her talk about anything other than being an immigrant, other than the fact that half her family died in Cambodia, that her dad killed himself on the twentieth anniversary of Tiananmen. Racial trauma sells, right? They treated her like a museum”

My main criticism with this book, however, is with its ending. Though you could say it's like a circle, karma, and so on, it felt a little _lacking_, missing, or something like that. (Spoilers) June is a bit mad by the end, so it makes some sorta sense for her to be so careless in that situation, and reveal her secrets. But it feels a little fast by the end. We hear she is writing a rebuttal with her _own_ version of the facts, and she is sure it _will_ sell. But we _don't_ see it.

It's meant to be punchy and fast, and it is (quite literally). But I felt some emptiness, I don't know how to explain? I wish we got a few more pages right there. It doesn't ruin the book, though, even being _fast_, it still got meaning and all that jazz. I just felt it wasn't as good as the rest of the book for me, or at least it wasn't as satisfying. (Note: I'm not saying that June should have a good ending nor anything like that).

Still, it must have been **one of my favorite reads this year.** It's SO good. I could write a lot more of my experience, but I will end it here.

Last reading of the year ❤️
