> “Porque há direito ao grito.
> Então eu grito.”

It took me a while to write about this one - it was even _hard_ for me to organize my feelings on it. I've never read Clarice Lispector before - I've heard her writing was a little different, how important she was and all, but that's all I knew.

> "Não esquecer que a estrutura do átomo não é vista mas sabe-se dela. Sei de muita coisa que não vi. E vós também. Não se pode dar uma prova da existência do que é mais verdadeiro, o jeito é acreditar. Acreditar chorando."

And boy, was this a ride. And one thing I definitely can't deny is, this woman could write ridiculously well. But that is both a boon and a bane, at least it was for me, at the time I was reading the book. Maybe I wasn't reading at the right time, possibly? I had but a few struggling brain cells at the beginning of the year! And they worked hard! (I guess??). But still - it took a while for me to engage with the book. So it made the first part, though rich in fascinating digression, also kinda of a slog to read?

> "Escrevo por não ter nada a fazer no mundo: sobrei e não há lugar para mim na terra dos homens. Escrevo porque sou um desesperado e estou cansado, não suporto mais a rotina de me ser e se não fosse sempre a novidade que é escrever, eu me morreria simbolicamente todos os dias."

Do I feel proud of feeling that? Not exactly. Maybe this is one of the books I should re-read another time. It was fascinating - I highlighted so many quotes, read some passages to my husband, and it was scintillating, in an odd way. The book has not much of a plot - we do follow a simple girl, Macabéa - and the story is narrated by what seems to be Clarice's persona.

The book is rather short, but it is undoubtedly rich, and one of those that makes me proud to be brazilian - we do make so many good books!

> "Tudo no mundo começou com um sim. Uma molécula disse sim a outra molécula e nasceu a vida. Mas antes da pré-história havia a pré-história da pré-história e havia o nunca e havia o sim. Sempre houve. Não sei o quê, mas sei que o universo jamais começou."

I was hesitating on how I should even rate the book - do I rate it like I felt during the book, or about how meaningful it is - and how brilliant I know it is.

I'm still not sure, but I decided for a middle ground. I might like this book more if I read it in a good, better headspace. Still, it was a great read, and the phrases and writing is simply fascinating.

I will leave a goodreads review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3215269892), that I think talks better than I do!
