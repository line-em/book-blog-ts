> “Whenever you feel afraid, just remember. Courage is the root of change - and change is what we're chemically designed to do. So when you wake up tomorrow, make this pledge. No more holding yourself back. No more subscribing to others' opinions of what you can and cannot achieve. And no more allowing anyone to pigeonhole you into useless categories of sex, race, economic status, and religion. Do not allow your talents to lie dormant, ladies. Design your own future. When you go home today, ask yourself what YOU will change. And then get started.”

This was interesting. The pages flew by - it read quickly, which was the opposite of my latest read (A Hora da Estrela). So I felt immersed, enjoyed a lot of things ( specially Six-Thirty, the dog! ), but in the end, it was a little so-so.

Let me put this upfront: I totally appreciate the message, and as a woman, a lot of things in this book rings true. It brings a powerful message, and props to the book, because it's important.

> “Every day she found parenthood like taking a test for which she had not studied. The questions were daunting and there wasn’t nearly enough multiple choice.”

However, to me - the last half, specially - felt a little too pep-talky to me. I read this on other reviews and I agree, the protagonist felt like a modern woman time travelling to that time. And I don't know - I guess I found a little bit of disconnect between the books themes. Sometimes it wanted to be serious, explored dark themes, and sometimes it tried to be too light and too quirky, with the genius daughter and so on. As a personal opinion, I think the book would resonate better with me if it wasn't too dissonant.

And I don't know if, maybe I'm too tired of saying and hearing the same things, but some quotes such as this made me more grow uninterested as I progressed in the book:
> “Sometimes I think," she said slowly, "that if a man were to spend a day being a woman in America, he wouldn't make it past noon.”

Like, it feels more like a punch line... Or like, despite everything in the book, phrases like this makes me think of it as superficial. Like the "show, don't tell". I felt like I was being told this over and over again. Honestly, it felt a little lazy, though I'm on the minority, I guess? 

I was also bothered by some small things, but this can be kinda nitpicky, I suppose. For instance, no one calls water H2O. Vinegar by its scientific name, and so on. I get the message - she is smart and wants to be taken seriously. But it felt like, too much, too forced? And Zott seemed to be portrayed as always superior - even on religious morals. I can get the idea - she was the embodiment of her fight, despite all she suffered. Still. Some aspects of the protagonist felt too much like a caricature. Which boils down to my previous point - sometimes the book is serious, sometimes it's light. I wouldn't be too bothered by it if it tended towards the lighter spectrum, mostly.

> “And as humans, we’re by-products of our upbringings, victims of our lackluster educational systems, and choosers of our behaviors. In short, the reduction of women to something less than men, and the elevation of men to something more than women, is not biological: it’s cultural. And it starts with two words: pink and blue. Everything skyrockets out of control from there.”

I do consider myself an atheist and agree on her points - her feelings echo what I tend to feel. Still.

In the end, I guess there were things I liked, some I didn't. Still, it's a nice book with a nice message - even though it didn't shine as bright to me. It's an alright book, and might (or not) resonate with you.

> “Take a moment for yourself," Harriet said, "Every day."
"A Moment."
"A moment where YOU are your own priority. Just you. Not your baby, not your work, not your dead Mr. Evans, not your filthy house, not anything. Just you. Elizabeth Zott. Whatever you need, whatever you want, whatever you seek, reconnect with it in that moment." She gave a sharp tug to her fake pearls. "Then recommit.”
