> “I saw a new world coming rapidly. More scientific, efficient, yes. More cures for the old sicknesses. Very good. But a harsh, cruel, world. And I saw a little girl, her eyes tightly closed, holding to her breast the old kind world, one that she knew in her heart could not remain, and she was holding it and pleading, never to let her go.”

I have somewhat mixed feelings about this book. 

There's many good ideas here. Nothing earth-shaking, and it feels a little predictable in some ways, but it is a nice story, nonetheless. It's also tragic, in many ways.

However. At first - it felt a little mundane. Having come to this book without reading much about it previously, I felt lost - where was everything going to go? Many recollections of a childhood that seemed pretty sheltered from the outside, but that was it.

> “I keep thinking about this river somewhere, with the water moving really fast. And these two people in the water, trying to hold onto each other, holding on as hard as they can, but in the end it's just too much. The current's too strong. They've got to let go, drift apart. That's how it is with us. It's a shame, Kath, because we've loved each other all our lives. But in the end, we can't stay together forever.” 

The problem, for me, is that it took a little to long to progress - and then, it felt like we already _kinda_ knew about what would happen. So maybe my problem was a bit with the pacing, I guess?

I find it fascinating, the whole idea - spoilers ahead! - about cloning people to donate organs, to try to build a more "humane" life for them, proving they have feelings _and a soul_. The plot itself is fine, even the relationships and all - one of the characters is frustrating, but due to their background, I can easily accept her behaviour!

> “The problem, as I see it, is that you've been told and not told. You've been told, but none of you really understand, and I dare say, some people are quite happy to leave it that way.”

So there's where I feel conflicted. I like the plot and the ideas, but something didn't click for me, nonetheless. I don't have a problem with the sorta? nihilistic ending, even if it was a little depressing. But _something_ didn't feel right, I suppose.
