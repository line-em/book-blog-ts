This was a **fantastic** reading. It's been a while since I last read a graphic novel, and this was a punch to the gut - in a good way!
This is a memoir, telling the coming of age of the author, Marjane, during the Islamic Revolution on Iran. Her childhood, teenage years, and so on. And there's so much to talk about, to _reflect_ about!

> “The regime had understood that one person leaving her house while asking herself:
Are my trousers long enough?
Is my veil in place?
Can my make-up be seen?
Are they going to whip me?
>
> No longer asks herself:
Where is my freedom of thought?
Where is my freedom of speech?
My life, is it liveable?
What's going on in the political prisons?” 

There's a lot of pain. I remember how sad I felt when her uncle was persecuted and died, after so many warm feelings between them. I felt my heart clench when the little girl that thought she was a prophet, started to understand the cruel ways the world around her was taking roots and expanding. The way the women were loosing rights, and how disconnected she felt sometimes.

But I also felt endeared. By the stories and love shared between her family, the care, the little rebellions. Her father bringing a poster from a "prohibited" band to his daughter after a trip. The stories and embraces between her and her grandma. So many little moments like this.

I guess this is why the book hits so hard - it has a lot of feelings, you care for the author and her experiences - and as someone from the West, it was pretty enlightening, to read about all of this.

Despite being from the other side of the world, I still felt connected to the author - as a woman, but mostly as an immigrant. The good parts, of course - but the bad ones too. The feelings of being lost, missing your culture, and so on. I had tough moments, myself, regarding this disconnect and general numbness - but I can only imagine how it must've been tenfold for the author, for being from a place where people has so much prejudice about.

This was fantastic, and I fear what I write here won't reflect my feelings on this book entirely. So. All I can say is that I loved it, **a lot.**

The worst is that the intervention in Kuwait is done in the name of the human rights! Which rights? Which humans?"
