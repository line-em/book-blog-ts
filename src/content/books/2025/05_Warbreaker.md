Aaaah, how good it feels to come back to dear old Sanderson?
I really liked this book - though it did take me a while to fully grasp the world and magic in this one. For some reason, I guess it was the terms? Like BioChromatic and so on, didn't really click at first. I **did** come to appreciate the magic and world building though, giving more time to familiarize myself.

But the main point for me here, wasn't necessarily the magic - but the politics and religion. That's where it truly shined in my eyes.

The story follows two princesses, whom, all of sudden, started to trail a different path from what was planned from them for before. Vivena, for instance, feels lost - she was trained her whole life for something - and now it was taken from her. Where does she go from there?

But they develop beautifully, both of them, even though they were, at first, "not prepared" for their new roles. The side characters are also amazing, I must say.

> “It was strange, how easily and quickly protection could cause destruction. Sometimes, Vasher wondered if the two weren't really the same thing. Protect a flower, destroy pests who wanted to feed on it. Protect a building, destroy the plants that could have grown in the soil. Protect a man. Live with the destruction he creates.” 

Someone I liked a lot was a god - from one of the religions from this book - who didn't believe in the faith and pantheon he belonged. There were so many conflicting world views - after all, the two kingdoms are almost clashing, and people from each see things pretty differently. Their beliefs and world views are constantly kept in check, both by meeting people from other cultures, but also by the reader. And it's pretty amazing, if I must say so.

> “What I'm trying to say is that you don't understand a man until you understand what makes him do what he does. Every man is a hero in his own story, Princess. Murderers don't believe that they're to blame for what they do. Thieves, they think they deserve the money they take. Dictators, they believe they have the right—for the safety of their people and the good of the nation—to do whatever they wish. . . . The truth is, most people who do what you'd call "wrong" do it for what they call "right" reasons. Only mercenaries make any sense. We do what we're paid to do. That's it. Perhaps that's why people look down on us so. We're the only ones who don't pretend to have higher motives. . . In a way, we're the most honest men you'll ever meet.” 

The start here is slow - but the last half was hard to put down. The revelations, true motivations, betrayals... Sanderson knows how to write climaxes that makes you very, very anxious to see how everything will unravel - and unravel it will.

The last bit of this book is intense - but I don't know if I rushed too much, but it felt really abrupt by the end.

Still, I liked this one a lot. Mostly due to the various contrasts, like the sisters, the religion, the politics, and so on. It also really fits the theme with the colors, I guess!

> “She loved the teachings of the Five Visions. Humility. Sacrifice. Seeing another's problems before your own. Yet she was beginning to think that she-- along with others-- had taken this belief too far, letting her desire to seem humble become a form of pride itself. She now saw that when her faith had become about clothing instead of people, it had taken a wrong turn.”
