> “And when the Empire is weak, it is often because a powerful few have denied us the abundance of our people.”

I had so much fun with this. I was reading "A Casa dos Espíritos", from Isabel Allende - which I don't doubt it's good! But I guess it wasn't a good match for me, at this time. I couldn't engage.

To be honest, I was twitching for a fantasy read again, after Warbreaker! But I also didn't want anything too long, like the Stormlight Archive's Rhythm of War - which I _will_ read, of course, but reading a 1k page-long book is a real commitment!

And so, The Tainted Cup appeared on my radar. Fantasy, check. Murder Mystery, check. Sherlock Holmes and Watsan interactions, check. And from an author I already enjoyed before, from Foundryside! I had to read it - and I wasn't disappointed.

> “Oh, people love the Legion, with their swords and their walls and their bombards. But though they receive no worship, it’s the maintenance folk who keep the Empire going. Someone, after all, must do the undignified labor to keep the grand works of our era from tumbling down.”

There's no romance between the leads - which, good God, is refreshing! And they're both interesting in their own right. Their quirks, personalities - but also the bond they share, the secrets shared (and not), it was delightful.

And the world? The world in pretty cool and creepy, always on edge. It made me think of Attack on Titan, maybe because The Empire resides between walls - and the further in, the more prestigious life is supposed to be. The wet season comes - and it always comes - and the walls have a real risk of falling apart.

> “But its strangest feature is that the more its citizens feel it is broken, the more broken it actually becomes.”

The "magic" here is pretty cool, as well. Always in the balance - for instance, the main character remembers everything he sees and hears. But down the line? The headaches, the exposure to normal life can trigger recollections, and so on, can make it pretty hard to live a normal life. The apoths and their concoctions to "improve" someone, but always with risks, the contagions always preying nearby. I really enjoyed this worldbuilding.

> “What a tool cynicism is to the corrupt, claiming the whole of the creation is broken and fraudulent, and thus we are all excused to indulge in whatever sins we wish—for what’s a little more unfairness, in this unfair world?”

The mystery was _nice_ - and there was always "one more mystery" to uncover. A cryptic death happens in a manor - vines and branches and trees starts blooming from the body of the victim. What caused it? And why?

Being a murder mystery book, I think it's best to leave it at that! But it was really fun, and I felt very immersed in the few days it took me to reach the end!

I can't wait to follow up with A Drop of Corruption, which I'm saving for my trip! But yeah. For lovers of fantasy and mysteries, this is definitively a must read.

> “Civilization is often a task that is only barely managed. But harden your heart and slow your blood. The towers of justice are built one brick at a time. We have more to build yet.”
