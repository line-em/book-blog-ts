> “Books are letters in bottles, cast into the waves of time, from one person trying to save the world to another.”

Two months later... And I feel no closer to knowing what to write about this one. Not exactly in a good way, I suppose?

I don't know. I couldn't click with it, and trust me, I wanted to - I heard a lot of this one! But I guess it was too purple-prosy, at times?

The world building is rather vague - intentionally, I feel - and there could be interesting things here. I love _love_ letters, I think they have a special charm - last year, I thought about **Divine Rivals** for so long, and it touched my little heart. But though there were feeling in the letters in this book, I found them hard to relate, I guess. Like:

> “I want to be a body for you. I want to chase you, find you, I want to be eluded and teased and adored; I want to be defeated and victorious—I want you to cut me, sharpen me. I want to drink tea beside you in ten years or a thousand. Flowers grow far away on a planet they’ll call Cephalus, and these flowers bloom once a century, when the living star and its black-hole binary enter conjunction.I want to fix you a bouquet of them, gathered across eight hundred thousand years, so you can draw our whole engagement in a single breath, all the ages we’ve shaped together.”

I felt like most of the book was this way. There's no issue at all, of course - but I guess it wasn't for me.

Well written, though, I can give it that!
