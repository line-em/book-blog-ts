> “There is no comfort like complicity.”

I'm writing this about... one month? After I read. I can think of two things about this book:
- How I already forgot _so much_
- How I enjoyed the ending.

So I will try my best to articulate about this book!

> “What is more important, that Caesar is assassinated or that he is assassinated by his intimate friends? … That,’ Frederick said, 'is where the tragedy is.”

Dark academia is a genre that always leaves me a bit uncertain... There are books I've really enjoyed — like [Ninth House](../../2022/21_Ninth_House.md) — and others I absolutely despised, such as [The Atlas Six](../../2022/12_The_Atlas_Six.md) (Apparently, [Piranesi](../../2022/10_Piranesi.md) also falls into this category! This one was a short but nice little gem). So, in theory, it's a genre I should love... but my experiences have ranged from very high to very low. This makes me feel a little conflicted and unsure how I'll react to any book that says that its part of this genre, you know?

This one was fine - now that I've forgotten quite a few things, it seems that most of it didn't really grab me. Though the ending, I thought it was really masterfully done.

For this book, I took a while to warm up to it. We have this (dysfunctional) group of friends. They're actors, and we feel like most of the time, they aren't very honest. Be it with each other - or themselves. Our main character, the one we follow most of the book, is an example of the latter.

A lot of tension starts to occur, though - be it on stage or backstage, involving one of them - Richard. And things start to escalate from that.

> “Were you in love with him?'
'Yes,' I say, simply. James and I put each other through the kind of reckless passions Gwendolyn once talked about, joy and anger and desire and despair. After all that, was it really so strange? I am no longer baffled or amazed or embarrassed by it. 'Yes, I was.' It's not the whole truth. The whole truth is, I'm in love with him still.” 

Now, a bit of spoilers about the ending (so maybe, a lot of spoilers?). We feel the "electricity" between James and the main character (I forgot his name) throughout the book, though it never gets fulfilled. Then the "sacrifice" happens, and one takes the fall for the other... This sequence was _good_, because we knew things would go wrong, and they did, in fact, go wrong. And there was nothing to be done, and we knew the aftermath, and how things would never be the same again.

But then, the letter. (_My love for letters ❤️._)

Though it's also off-screen, we get the possibility of things getting better again. Of them - finally - having a shot of being with each other. It ended on a hopeful note I wasn't expecting, and it felt nice. It also felt _possible_ because they have their own riddles, their way of speaking - and James could've "paying" his penance in another way.

I don't know. I felt like it was intriguing, and hopeful - and it being open and not showing all its cards made it better.

Easily the best part of the book for me.
