> “Wars were fought in hearts and minds as much as they were fought in blood and bullets.”

This one was light, short, and fun. Made me think of **The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet**, which is always a good sign! I loved how the sisters interacted, the relationships they formed. In special, I loved everything connected to the Mother Superior - her backstory, and how everyone related to her in some way.

> “There would be blood spilled again, across worlds and worlds, there might be war, or plague. And the universe would need them to do what small good things they could, even in the face of that which they could not stop. If all they could be were small rocks to break the current, it would have to be enough.”

But, I also felt the story - despite its sad parts - hopeful and sweet. I'm not particularly religiosus, but I felt that, at least the Sisters of the Our Lady of Impossible Constellations embody what I feel is the ideal. Wanting to do good, no matter what. So I feel like, although the shtick of "nuns in space" may be a great hook - the story deliveries a great narrative, with an earnestness to it that felt good to me.

I also enjoy the concept of living ships - I already read some books that explored the concept ([Just Out of Jupiter](../../2023/19_JustOutOfJupitersReach)'s Reach comes to mind), and I'd love to read more takes on this concept as well!

I also loved the ending:

> Outside, the stars glittered cold and uncaring, for they had endured long before humanity and would endure long after. She took comfort in them, and their light, as it reached to her through time. Some of those stars were gone, and they would not know for years; others had swelled to gas giants or collapsed to brown dwarfs, and yet the light that reached here was young and hale. She was one small part of an infinity, and there was much to be done.

So, to sum it up: very heartwarming, and I had an absolute amazing time with this. ❤️
