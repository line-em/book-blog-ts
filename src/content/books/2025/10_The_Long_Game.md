This one... I felt at the beginning that it could turn out interesting... But it became rather boring.

There wasn't much plot - though the idea tha we had an alien species, with a whole different nature and so on, could be cool to explore. Discussions on life, and so on...

But it turned out to be mostly these discussions throghout the whole short story, and it didn't seem to reach much of a point/conclusion.

I didn't enjoy this much.
