Oh god, this one was fantastic! I _loved_ the first book in this series, and this continued the trend. 

> “It is good to place oneself before the vast expanse of this world,”  said Ana. “The ocean cannot tell the difference between a rich man and a poor one, nor one full of happiness, nor despair. To those waves, all are so terribly small.”

Being a lover for both mystery and fantasy, of course, this instigates me deeply. The mysteries and this universe is so full of wonder and creepiness in equal measures, and you never know what may happen, what you may come across. Still, it makes sense - and each new discovery made me want to read more. The graveyards, the magical and tense things that may happen, and so on.

BUT what's wonderful in this read is not only the mysteries or the characters, though they sure are great. But the _themes_ themselves are great. The discussions, philosophies, everything in between is very inspiring and relatable. When the characters struggle, why they do what they do.

> “But … when we come, the deed is already done. The body is cold, the blood cleaned away. We often find the killer, but that heals nothing, as far as I can see. It only leads to a rope, or a cage, and many more tears.” I swallowed. “Is it so strange a thing, ma’am, to helplessly look upon the slain and dream of instead saving lives?”

>  “I suspect you shall come to realize what many Iudexii eventually learn—that though the Legion defends our Empire, it falls to us to keep an Empire worth defending.”

It's worth noting that the author has deep beliefs, and it is even clearer in the author notes! And it's amazing and honestly, I wish I saw more fantasy stories that shared this POV. It's a very good read. You can see how it's peppered throughout the story, and it is all the better for it.

> “The second decade of the twenty-first century seems replete with examples as to why autocracies are, to put it mildly, very stupid. Our headlines are dominated by regimes with one nigh-all-powerful man at the top making any number of terrible choices, and then – to the bafflement of the entire globe – doubling down on them, thus inflicting massive suffering on his people. It seems the talents that make a man capable of navigating palace intrigue until he wins the throne generally don’t coexist with the talents required for – or even a passing interest in – good governance.” 
> “Yet if the 2010’s awed us with the power of autocrats, the 2020’s seem hell-bent to refute it. More and more, it becomes impossible to deny that autocrats – like any ruler – are but men, yet men with no obligation to listen their people, and thus acknowledge reality. This, in turn, makes them fools: fools that are very difficult to dislodge from their thrones, true, but fools nonetheless.” 

I can't wait to read the next one - it's truly delightful!
