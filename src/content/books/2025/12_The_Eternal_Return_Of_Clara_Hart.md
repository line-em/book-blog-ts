> Consequences. We have to live with ourselves no matter what. Crack after crack at this day, but I'm always me at the end. That's the tragedy.

This book is very short, but it brings a good message.

Basically, our main character is stuck in a time loop, where Clara Hart, a colleague, is constantly getting killed. What is happening with her, and how can he avoid it?

He has to confront friends and beliefs. I believe this would be an even better read for teens, despite its strong themes. But it's important to be aware and confront when you see red flags, SPECIALLY with people close to us.

It was a good and quick read, though heavy.
