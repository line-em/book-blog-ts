It took me a real long time to engage with this book. The main group got separated, which, ok, makes sense (specially at Kissenâ€™s case, as she is presumed dead), but the story and pacing got really, really slow.

I think the main cast has a lot of chemistry together, Kissen, Inara, Skedi, and Elo. But, except for the last few pages, they weren't all together even once.

The plot progresses, the stakes get higher - and the last stretch of the book was pretty good. Still - it took way too long, and the characters and their found family dynamic was some of the aspects that have drawn me to this series. This book deviated, and I missed those aspects that endeared me to the books.

I will read the last book, as now it's only a little bit longer. But being honest, I kinda lost a bit of my previous excitement, and hope the last book has more of what made it so special.
