This book... Was a little weird. I felt it had the ingredients for a good story and mystery, but in the end, it didn't deliver (to me). Also: that ending!! It was _so_ cheesy and it actually made my rating decrease a little bit. 

So! I actually liked that the protagonist had various identities and so on, but much of what happened around her, I couldn't really explain or relate. 
- She had a best friend that did every job with her, no matter the difficulties. This best friend always found good solutions. We have no insight about them whatsoever. 
- How many of those plans actually work, all the luck involved, there's so much suspension of disbelief needed to enjoy this. 
- The writing, though not bad per se, felt a little juvenile at times, which threw me out of the tension and plot. 
- A lot of tell, to explain the plot. 

The ending was the worst, for me, though. The romance going on, was, alright, easy to spot. But the ending, the interactions between them, and the Ms. Smith shtick didn't work for me, not that way though. 

To sum it up. Entertaining at times, but not a very memorable ride. 

> “There’s an old saying: The first lie wins. It’s not referring to the little white kind that tumble out with no thought; it refers to the big one. The one that changes the game. The one that is deliberate. The lie that sets the stage for everything that comes after it. And once the lie is told, it’s what most people believe to be true. The first lie has to be the strongest. The most important. The one that has to be told.”
