This was an interesting and fast read, I think. The conflicts and inner dialogues that happens to the main character are completely understandable, and the story and narrative flows really easily. It’s a bit frustrating, when we don’t get all the answers, but here it feels intentional. You basically know the ending from the start.

I felt this book was mostly philosophical and inquiring than actually plot or character driven, and that’s fine by me. And the reflections, the ponderings, the eagerness for learning, that defines the POV of our main character, _who have never known men,_ is pretty compelling.

In the end, however, it’s a bit hard not to feel a liiitle let down by the lack of answers, even though that’s explicitly the goal. At least that’s how I felt. Still, it was a nice story, a nice journey. A tale of how we take our things for granted, and also about time, legacy, purpose. I enjoyed it a lot.

It’s also very well written.

> “If you do something that is forbidden, it is the action that is the target. If you do something that isn't forbidden, and they intervene, then it's not the activity that's attracting the attention, it is you yourself.”

Also, a really, really lonely book, and it’s inevitable to feel a little sad and blue, I think.
