> “One cannot, at once, claim to be superhuman and then plead mortal error. I propose to take our countrymen’s claims of American exceptionalism seriously, which is to say I propose subjecting our country to an exceptional moral standard.” 

This book is _strong_. And I like it for it. There were many parts that resonated with me (as an immigrant), there were parts which were completely new to me and made me ponder and reflect. And it was pretty short and sweet - a letter for his son, so the language was compelling, to the point, and blunt. But that was awesome.

> “And I saw that what divided me from the world was not anything intrinsic to us but the actual injury done by people intent on naming us, intent on believing that what they have named us matters more than anything we could ever actually do. In America, the injury is not in being born with darker skin, with fuller lips, with a broader nose, but in everything that happens after.”

I will admit that it took me a while to get into the book - there are a lot of American references that I just couldn’t relate, or remember, or that I haven’t ever heard. It’s not bad by itself, and always a gateway to learn more, but I do admit it took me out of the reading at times.

> “But race is the child of racism, not the father. And the process of naming “the people” has never been a matter of genealogy and physiognomy so much as one of hierarchy. Difference in hue and hair is old. But the belief in the preeminence of hue and hair, the notion that these factors can correctly organize a society and that they signify deeper attributes, which are indelible—this is the new idea at the heart of these new people who have been brought up hopelessly, tragically, deceitfully, to believe that they are white.”

I liked his depictions of the Dream, how it impacts and shapes racism, how we artificially created labels and boxes to divide ourselves. The pain and resilience, and what it’s like to grow up feeling rather powerless - and what to teach our children. It was enlightening, and I think many people can benefit from reading this book.

> “I was made for the library, not the classroom. The classroom was a jail of other people’s interests. The library was open, unending, free.”

I also liked that he brought up points I didn’t think about, and that was enlightening. I really enjoyed his book, getting to know his point of view, memories and reflections - and it being a letter, it had that intrinsic warmth that I really enjoy.

A really good book.
