> “Each time you happen to me all over again.”

So, so good.

This is one of the books that has so many layers, and the more I thought about the title, the story, the conflicts... It's very clever and insightful, and makes me remember why I love some classics so much.

Though there are some elements of Romance here, this is not the focus. Wharton shows us a full picture of the entrapments, the dilemmas, the difficulties surrounding New York society at the time, and how our 3 main characters fare in it: The eccentric Countess Olenska, the main character, Newland Archer, and the more traditional, conventional lady, May Welland.

> “Women ought to be free - as free as we are,' he declared, making a discovery of which he was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences.”

The characters are all delightfully gray, and between them are conflicts, the art of talking "without talking" of the era, etc. The triangle between them is full of nuance, and represents tradition, love, etc.

The title is specially good here - The Age of Innocence could be an acidic reference of a time built around modesty, but has nasty little corner everywhere. It could also be about Olenska and Archer relationship, which was a fleeting dream. The Innocence that Archer associated with May, but that was _not quite_ innocent.

I enjoyed this a really great deal - and the end, though sad, made sense to me. It was very bittersweet, but I really adored the journey.

Well, she has opened my eyes too; it's a delusion to say she blinds people. What she does is the contrary-she fastens their eyelids open, so they're never again in the blessed darkness.”
