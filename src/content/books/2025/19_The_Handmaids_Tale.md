> “Better never means better for everyone... It always means worse, for some.”

This was absolutely amazing, and I couldn’t help but keep talking about this to a lot of other people, after finally reading it!

> “We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the stories.”

Though I knew some of the themes about this book previously, they were very minor, and I think going blind was the best decision I took. The rituals, the revelations, the anxiety - it all shook me, and I believe it wouldn’t have hit so hard if I knew it from the series or stuff like that. To know that everything that’s happened is based of something that already did happen is scary, and Margaret Atwood is a really good storyteller.

> “A rat in a maze is free to go anywhere, as long as it stays inside the maze.”

I also loved how introspective it is, in a sense. **The freedom to and freedom from** got me, for instance. When talking about having “freedom to drive”, to vote, to _do_ things. And now (in Gilead) having “freedom from crime, insecurities”, etc. 

In general, all of Aunt Lydia’s lessons were - in a way - interesting, to understand Gilead, that world, and so on.

> “There is more than one kind of freedom," said Aunt Lydia. "Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from. Don't underrate it.”

But I really loved this book. Offred silent strength, the odd and dangerous kinship that formed, the tension, the ending - the ending was particularly fun, and I _loved_ how the book didn’t offer all the answers. Trying to decipher what happen, the consequences, what changed - and specially - what didn’t.

>“If it's a story I'm telling, then I have control over the ending...  
> But if it's a story, even in my head, I must be telling it to someone.  
> You don't tell a story only to yourself. There's always someone else. Even when there is no one.”

So gripping. I won’t forget this book anytime soon, I think.
