> “Art is not one great act of creation, but many small ones. When you read one of my poems, you fail to see the weeks of careful work it took me to build it--the thinking, the scratched-out words, the pages I burned in disgust. All you see, in the end, is what I want you to see.”

This almost 900 pages-long book was my constant companion during an injury, and I really loved my time with it! I really missed reading an epic - and bonus points, for it is a standalone book! (I since learned that there is one more book, but honestly, I think I feel satisfied with this.)

I liked the characters and how they connected, their interweaving stories, even when they were far away. Their different beliefs, myths, customs - and how they all connected in a way, like pieces in a puzzle. It was very fun following along and trying to think about how it would all become a whole piece.

>“To be kin to a dragon, you must not only have a soul of water. You must have the blood of the sea, and the sea is not always pure. It is not any one thing. There is darkness in it, and danger, and cruelty. It can raze great cities with its rage. Its depths are unknowable; they do not see the touch of the sun. To be a Miduchi is not to be pure, Tané. It is to be the living sea. That is why I chose you. You have a dragon’s heart.”

I specially liked the romance between Ead and the Queen, and how real and difficult it was - because, of couse, with so many things going on - and they having such different roles and parts to play, how could it be different? I loved that it wasn’t downplayed. That it wasn’t immediate. Their care for each other slowly grew and it was a tender journey, I really enjoyed reading their story.

> “When history fails to shed light on the truth, myth creates its own.”

I also love the dragons and their bonds, and so on. The only thing I will say, is that I thought the rhythm was not perfect, I think - some things took too long, others, too fast (like the final battle). It affected me a little, at certain points.

Still, this was an amazing journey, and I loved every minute!
