> “It takes a lifetime to make a friend, but you can lose one in an hour,” she recites. “Life without a friend is life without sun. Life without a friend is death.”

It has been a while since I read historical fiction, and this was very very interesting. It’s a time period - and place - I’m very distant to, so I feel like it was important to get to know more about it - but not only that, It gave me a fresh lens on female rights, friendship and medicine in a time where these things were inherently complicated, due to Confucian values, customs and laws.

> “You must speak if you wish to be heard.” Her features soften, perhaps because she realizes she’s been harsh. “I’m not angry at you,” she says. “I’m irritated with men. I’m lucky to love your grandfather, but most men—other doctors, especially—don’t like to see us succeed. You must always show them respect and let them think they know more than you do, while understanding that you can achieve something they never can. You can actually help women.”

I felt immersed in it, even if at times I felt a little lost / disconnected, due to not being familiar with the culture and themes. Though, of course, this book is a stepping stone in remedying that!

One high praise I’d give this book is that I feel like not only I learned something, but I also got very _curious_ about the time period! Some things thins like foot binding were very preeminent in the book, and I admit it scares me a little bit - but immediately after finishing the book, I got curious and started reading articles about the practice. 

> “But I believe we have even more to gain than a husband’s admiration, and that is compassion. We may not care for concubines, but it’s important to remember that each one came from the womb of a woman. Every girl—no matter how small-minded or unfortunate—had a mother who nursed and cared for her.”
