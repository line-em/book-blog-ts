This book took me a while to read - but it was fun and creative, and totally deserve props for the unique characters and situations. Two magical old ladies, a demon-chicken, bone dogs, and a story with a good start and satisfying ending. The romance was _ok_, and the resolution a bit simple (though it is meant to be a fairytale), but it was fun.

A quote I found on Goodreads:
> Nettle & Bone is what happens when all the overlooked bit players of classic fantasy somehow wind up on the main quest. It's funny, frightening, and full of heart; I loved it.

One thing I liked, was that we don't usually see the stories about abuse through the lens of a family member, so that was a cool premise - so that our main character could save her sister. It was interesting! And there were funny moments.

> “No.” That was loud enough that Marra winced. “I am giving up my power in order to be decent. If warriors are allowed to stop killing people and bang their swords into plowshares, I ought to be allowed to keep chickens and give children good health and not curse them.”

Although, being honest - I didn't connect too much with it. So: props for the uniqueness and all, but I wasn't too enchanted by it. Which is a shame - I was absolutely curious about this book!

> Nothing is fair, except that we try to make it so. That's the point of humans, maybe, to fix things the gods haven't managed.
